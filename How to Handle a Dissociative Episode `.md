## [[How to Handle a Dissociative Episode]]


Dissociation is a normal human response to trauma, serving as a coping mechanism for torture and disturbing memories. If someone appears spacey, unaware of their surroundings, or in a fugue state, they may be dissociating. There is no evidence suggesting that dissociated individuals are more prone to violence; in fact, they are often more likely to be victims of violence.

For those experiencing dissociation or supporting someone who does, a weighted blanket can be helpful. Often, individuals need space during dissociation and may require assistance to leave triggering environments. One example involves a person who dissociated in a bar displaying nazi insignia to calmly exit despite experiencing a panic attack. In this instance, dissociation was an adaptive safety mechanism.

Another example involves a friend undergoing a difficult legal process. She described her dissociative episodes as starting with overwhelming physical pain followed by a complete blankness.

Dissociation can be a warning sign of human trafficking. Recognizing these signs is crucial, as there may be limited opportunities to help someone under the control of an abuser.

If you notice someone dissociating, approach them gently and respectfully. Ask if they are okay or need to sit down. Offer water, food, or a quiet space. Give them time and space to calm down and gently encourage their return to the present with occasional check-ins. This can be done verbally or nonverbally, such as through facial expressions or simple questions about the surroundings.
