## Cultivating Community and Solidarity

To foster justice and solidarity, we can empower our local arts scene by providing buskers – artists, musicians, and craftspeople – with accessible venues and spaces to share their talents and earn a living. Local churches can further support musicians by hosting concerts, offering them exposure and fair compensation. Recognizing that buskers enrich the tourist economy, we should actively support their presence.

Investing in vocational training for those eager to learn valuable skills is crucial for building a prosperous, sustainable, and resilient future for generations to come. Addressing the drug culture and addiction requires fostering cohesive communities and genuine human connections that uplift our most vulnerable members.

Prioritizing the well-being of our residents is paramount. Offering city-wide benefits for those who work or volunteer to improve our community can cultivate a culture of compassionate cities. We can amplify these positive initiatives by widely sharing good practices on social media using the hashtag #CompassionateCities. Let's encourage our city councils to prioritize these values and make compassion an attractive and business-friendly principle for those in power. If you agree with this vision, please share it and highlight positive actions in your own city on Instagram.

Extend a hand of companionship by joining free meals, not as a volunteer, but as someone seeking connection. Build friendships, listen to people's stories, share a meal, and understand their needs. Embrace the role of a "gift fairy" or "guardian angel" by discreetly identifying needs and working with others to make life a little brighter. Remember, solidarity goes beyond charity. To dismantle inequality, those who have must stand alongside those who have less, sharing experiences and working together as equals.

### A Personal Perspective on Community and Resilience

For the past year, I've found contentment living in my vehicle, aligning my sleep with the natural rhythm of the sun, waking up energized and ready to contribute. However, the impending winter and the gradual failure of my vehicle's suspension present a growing concern. Throughout the week, I participate in free meals that welcome everyone who is hungry, regardless of their housing situation. Many of the individuals I've met, who are currently experiencing homelessness, are so much more than their present circumstances. A simple act of buying someone lunch or sharing leftovers with a hungry person could make a significant difference. While acknowledging that some individuals may have ill intentions, shouldn't we prioritize helping those in need? Instead of focusing on the financial aspect, consider the positive impact such kindness can have. Experiencing a day of fasting can also provide a deeper understanding of what hunger feels like.

Some cities criminalize homelessness. Instead, let's focus on banning destitution. We can address visible signs of hardship by providing public showers. We can eliminate hunger by encouraging restaurants and grocery stores to donate their fresh, surplus food to free meal programs and pantries. We can reduce homelessness by prioritizing low-income housing. And we can empower vulnerable populations, particularly women, through self-defense classes. It is also important to ensure the safety and comfort of individuals who are car camping and help them prepare for the challenges they may face.
