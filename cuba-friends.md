## Cuba Friends

Something about me. My faith community regularly makes trips to rural Cuba, to build partnership and relation with the people there. 
Cuba is the island nation painted with vibrant colors, where the rhythm of salsa spills from open cafes and vintage cars cruise along palm-lined streets. It's a place of undeniable beauty, but also one facing challenges due to long-standing sanctions. Yet, despite these hardships, the Cuban people radiate warmth and resilience.

### Did you know?  
_Cuba, through its Latin American School of Medicine (ELAM), has educated over 30,000 doctors from underserved communities around the world, including a significant number of African Americans from the United States._ This program provides free medical education, fostering a future generation of doctors who can bridge healthcare gaps and make a positive impact in their communities. It's a powerful example of how, even amidst challenges, Cuba is reaching out to create a better world, even for the US.

Last April, we had two Pastors from Cuba visit us. And it was a weekend many will never forget. 

On Friday was the local Tourists baseball game. Our Congregation sold tickets to fundraise for water system repairs in the rural village of Matanzas. 

On Saturday, we took our friends to Hooker Falls, for a hike, lunch at the picnic area, and some time by the base of the waterfall to put our feet in. 

Saturday night, we had a big home fiesta. For dinner we had rice and beans, with fruit, and pico de gallo, and fresh tortillas. 

April got picked on, by all the people saying they made those authentic Mexican tortillas from scratch before dinner, instead of buying them immediately before from a local Tienda. Everyone should be nicer to them..

Everyone got to practice their Spanish that night. Our Congregation has a lot of Spanish as a second languages speakers.

This Sunday, we are meeting with our friends before service to learn about the struggles people are facing in Matanzas and how they can be supported by a partnering friendship.
