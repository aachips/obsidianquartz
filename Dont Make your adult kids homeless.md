## How to not make your adult children homeless

Marty Nemko's perspective on adult children needing a push towards independence has sparked much discussion. However, for some young adults, particularly those facing unique challenges, the "nuclear option" of forced eviction can be devastating and counterproductive. As someone who has experienced homelessness firsthand after being asked to leave my parents' home, I offer a different viewpoint rooted in personal experience and a desire for more humane solutions.

Instead of viewing adult children struggling to launch as immature individuals needing a harsh lesson, consider approaching them with empathy and open communication. Remember, the path to independence is rarely linear, and societal shifts have made it increasingly challenging for young adults to achieve financial stability. The decline of long-term employment, the rise of the gig economy, and stagnant wages all contribute to this reality.
### Understanding the Challenges:

Many factors can hinder an adult child's ability to achieve independence, including:

- Mental health challenges: Anxiety, depression, and neurodevelopmental conditions can significantly impact a person's ability to secure and maintain employment and housing.
- Disabilities: Physical or cognitive disabilities may create barriers to independent living.
- The high cost of living: Even with employment, wages may not keep pace with soaring housing costs, making saving for a deposit or affording rent nearly impossible.
- Unexpected life events: Job loss, illness, or relationship breakdowns can destabilize even the most determined young adult.
- Lack of social safety nets: For some, family support is the only buffer against homelessness.

Beyond the "Nuclear Option": Exploring Supportive Alternatives

When frustration mounts, it's crucial to remember that eviction can lead to dangerous situations, increasing the risk of trauma, incarceration, exploitation, and trafficking. Instead of viewing it as a necessary push, consider these alternative approaches:

- Open and Honest Dialogue: Engage in respectful conversations about expectations, goals, and challenges. Listen actively to your child's perspective and work together to create a realistic plan.
- Facilitated Living Arrangements: Explore options beyond your own home. Could your child temporarily live with another family in a "pay as you can" arrangement or offer reciprocal support, such as companionship or help around the house? This provides a different environment with new perspectives and can foster a sense of community. My own positive experience with a retired individual who offered housing highlights the potential of this model.
- Collaborative Problem-Solving: Instead of dictating solutions, work together to identify barriers and brainstorm potential solutions. This could involve exploring vocational training, connecting them with relevant support services, or assisting with job searches.
- Clear Expectations and Boundaries (with Consent): Establish clear and mutually agreed-upon expectations and boundaries, potentially even through a written agreement. This fosters accountability while respecting everyone's needs.
- Seek External Support: If communication is strained or you feel ill-equipped to handle the situation, consider family therapy or mediation.
- Focus on Skill-Building: Instead of solely focusing on financial independence, help your child develop essential life skills, such as budgeting, cooking, and household management.
- Understand Systemic Barriers: Educate yourself on the challenges young adults face in today's economy and housing market. This broader understanding can foster empathy and inform your approach.
- Volunteer Together: If your frustration stems from a perceived lack of effort, consider volunteering together at organizations assisting the vulnerable. This can broaden perspectives and foster humility.
## Long-Term Solutions, Not Quick Fixes:

Supporting your adult child is not always a quick fix, especially if unhealthy patterns have developed over time. Be patient, and if you recognize that you may have enabled a lack of boundaries, seek your own support through therapy or support groups.

Ultimately, a more humane and effective approach involves treating your adult children with respect, fostering open communication, and exploring supportive alternatives that acknowledge the complexities of their journey towards independence. By shifting our perspective, we can move away from potentially damaging "nuclear options" and towards solutions that truly help young adults thrive.
