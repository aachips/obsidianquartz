Hello, I'm April, also known as Chips. This introductory video explains why I'm joining, my goals, and what I offer, addressing a potential issue regarding my avatar. I run a small seasonal apple chip business utilizing local overstock; my avatar is an apple chip with my website.

I've been aware of parental alienation for a decade, witnessing my family's efforts to remove my young person's father without valid reason, which I didn't address at the time. Later, it happened to me.

My internet-savvy young person is mainly on Tiktok. I've been developing a website to connect through my brand, even though direct contact is restricted. The website has a chat widget, and my blog will include educational resources for youth navigating parental alienation.

I'm also learning to create tribute web pages with saved content like memes, articles, and songs for loved ones' birthdays and holidays.

One video goal is to gain comfort in creating meaningful video content for a supportive Youtube/Tiktok presence as a parasocial "Uncle/Auntie" for young people.

My journey involves going no contact with a parent in 2017 due to unresolved issues and a threatening wellness check during a vulnerable time as a mobile individual with undiagnosed allergies. This led to homelessness and rebuilding my life, but also alienation from a young person, likely as retaliation for my no contact. I refuse demands to return and beg forgiveness to regain contact.

Even if reconnection fails, my content aims to support other young people facing similar troubled family dynamics. This generation faces immense pressure and often lacks essential life skills until adulthood. Children need a supportive community, and if that fails, they have the right to reject it. Nice to meet you.
