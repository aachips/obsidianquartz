Tuesday AM 12:45

I'm wide awake and can't sleep. I'm at Susan's. My back hurts. I spent 45 minutes weeping. I'm so stressed about dealing with my family. I'm scared to tell Dad that Mom told me he maritally raped her. I feel like I am being guilt tripped into going to Katie’s wedding. I'm tired of putting aside my true feelings and desires my entire life to please other people. I'm tired of being treated like an incompetent child. I just want to live my own life. I need to be proactive about my back so it doesn't do what it did last Christmas. I need to hold strong in my boundaries. Otherwise I am going to be drained ethereally, my back is going to be broken, and I'm going to die early on.

I communicated to her adequate times that I am anxious-avoidant and that if she could not be attentive and calm when I am having a meltdown or panic attack, then things would not work out. I listened, believed, and cared for her agonizing Fibromyalgia. I found her to be very coercive(at best) around sex, insisting that orgasms were her ‘pain medicine.’ This went from benignly consensual and wonderful sexy time, to guilt trips, to her storming into my sleeping area at 4 AM without prior consent or agreement, getting in my bed bad, grope/molesting me while I lay completely silent, and berating me verbally out of her apartment when I worked up the strength to push her away. I am not claiming rape, but a downward trend towards my severe sexual discomfort around her and my consent to not matter. Outside of that her chronic pain pushed her to be inflammatory in her relationships and engaged in life-alienating communication. My own examples of this are her using the slur ‘retard’ around me while I am learning disabled and care for a young man with Down Syndrome. Bullying me for saying no when she really wanted something. Kicking me out of her apartment either directly or through fear in the middle of the night when I had been sleeping for hours. One time for making a pot of rice at 2 AM because she disagreed with how I cook rice. She was a wonderful mother to her infant son, but terrible in almost every other relationship in her life. I have documented all facebook, and phone communication(when I started picking up on red flags but di not have the courage to leave teh situation) I had with her as well as meticulous visit notes. She had wanted the visit notes to help in her court. I don’t feel like the visit notes will be of much help in her situation, so I offered an agreement. I would send the notes to her freely and gladly if she enrolled, through her peer support network in DBT-based therapy, aimed at Emotional Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Effectiveness. She was ruled against in court on basis of a personality disorder, which is not a barrier to her being an effective parent, but is a barrier to her maintaining good graces in ALL of her relations, especially those which govern the wellbeing of her son. I gave her three weeks notice that I was leaving and she should find another supervisor. She had not been receptive to my suggestions and I completely understand her resistance given our history, however these are very serious matters governing whether she will have legal guardianship of her son for the rest of his minor life. My largest mistake was getting romantically involved in the situation. Had that not been a factor I may had been able to be of service in a healthier way.
