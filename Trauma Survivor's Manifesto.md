## Trauma Survivor's Manifesto

+ What happened to me is real.
+ It's impact on me is profound.
+ I have a right to be heard.
+ I have a right to be taken seriously.
+ I have a right to grieve for as long as it takes.
+ I have a right to pursue justice.
+ I have a right to decide what justice means to me.
+ I have a right to trauma-informed care.
+ I have a right to own both my victimhood and survivorhood.
+ I have the option but not the duty to forgive.
