### 1. “Guay de mi”

The equivalent of the universally applicable “oy.” My personal favorite.

### 2. “Haberes buenos”

“Good news,” for those optimistic moments.

### 3. “Echar lashon”

The equivalent of “schmooze,” a Jewish pastime.

### 4. “Bavajadas”

“Nonsense.” A perfect exclamation.

### 5. “Bivas, kreskas, engrandeskas, komo un peshiko en aguas freskas! Amen!”

A wayyyy too long “bless you.” I dare you to say this one five times fast.

### 6. “Aksi bashi”

“A grouch.” Probably an uncle.

### 7. “Kapara”

Essentially “the mistake could be worse.” A better version of ~shrug~.

### 8. “Me vas a tratar un ayiscrin”

“You are treating me to an ice cream.” Perhaps the most important demand; this should be used 24/7.

### 9. “Djente de piron”

“The one percent” or literally “people of the fork.” Did I include this so I could be the Sephardic Bernie Sanders? Definitely. Universal health care and utensils for all!

### 10. “Hadras i baranas”

“A big fuss.” Probably an aunt.

### 11. “Engleneate!”

“Have fun!” What your mom says to you after making sure you have a coat and a fully charged cell phone.

### 12. “Las anyadas non azen sezudos, eyas non azen ke viejos”

“The years don’t make people wise, they just make them old.” If my sources are correct, this is what I believe the kids call savage.

### 13. “Kuando se eskurese es para amaneser”

“When it’s dark out, that’s because dawn is coming.” See, I can be optimistic! This one particularly rings true and provides hope for our scary, uncertain times.

### 14. “Todos los dedos de la mano no son unos”

“All the fingers of the hand are not the same,” AKA we are all different. Amen.

On that note of diversity, as Dr. Naar puts it, “Ladino is a language that builds bridges.” It intersects with Hebrew, Spanish, Arabic, and a whole map of countries it’s passed through. We are made stronger by using language and our commonalities. Just as I will continue to love bagels, babka, Yiddish, and Fiddler on the Roof, I think it’s about time we do the same for Ladino.
