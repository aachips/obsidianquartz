"We had an outdoor, public park visit with Ellie planned. So that all the kids to see each other. We leave our house that morning, Katie calls me and says she does not want Sydnee (my wife) to come. I told her that it was too late, we were already in route. She loses her shit and cancels the visit. So, we take the kids to Graves mountain, which is out of cell phone range. We get signal back a few hours later, and Katie had blown my phone up, I had several missed calls and some nasty texts. I called her back and told her where we had been and that I didn't get her calls. She says she doesn't want to hear it.

Oh, and this visit was also to tell Ellie in person that Sydnee and I were going to move back to Texas, because COVID and not having a support structure in VA was making life very difficult to maintain in VA. Not a decision I came to lightly, but my visits with Ellie, while more frequent, were less quality and I was working when she was visiting. So I got to see her for a handful of hours during her weekend visits.. Mostly during the commute back and forth."
