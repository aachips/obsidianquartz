April’s Apple Chips offers two types of ‘Chiptocurrency.’

There are two types of chips. One is a food made from overstock apples that is dried into a compact, nutrient-dense snack that can be eaten on the go. The other is a concept in Data and Computer Science that I created. It refers to measured files containing useful, fun, and educational content. I believe that chips have the potential to change the way we use computers, learn, and live in a post-climate change world.

Chips are simple. There are different sizes for both print and digital chips. I prefer to use 8.5" x 11", which is the standard size for printer paper. You can use smaller or larger sizes. Generally, chips are text files or are written in Markdown. They are styled, formatted, and attractive. They contain helpful information on a topic or subject. This page explaining chips is an example of a chip.

Cookies are text files that websites store on your computer to track your activity. Chips are similar to cookies, but they are designed to spread helpful content instead of tracking information. They can contain games, activities, songs, and other types of content. Chips are broken up into small units that you can choose, collect, and curate as local files on your device. You can download hundreds or thousands of chips into a Documents folder and do whatever you want with them. Chips are open source by default, which means that anyone can view and modify the code. I am sharing ten one-page "Chips" about climate change in this public Google Drive folder. You can access them at this link or by scanning the QR code with your smartphone. From there, you can choose to download the entire folder to your computer. Most people will be familiar with .docx files, which are Microsoft Word documents. There is also a .md version for Markdown files, which are more compact and can be opened with any of dozens of free text editors available online.

By saving these locally on your computer. They will be available offline. In circumstances where you may not have access to internet, you may have accumulated Chips you can read and interact with. This can be really great if you live in a deadzone, or are a displaced person such as a refugee, or person experiencing homelessness. Some Chips can contain essential information and resources that may be helpful in certain situations.
