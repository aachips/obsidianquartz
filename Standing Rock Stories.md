I still think about Standing Rock almost every day. This week is extremely painful.  

Left today at about 9:30 and drove straight to Ohio. Felt out of place when I got there. Ran into a couple of familiar faces, but no one too personal.Was looking forward to Vegan Cooking which happens every Tuesday night. It was canceled this week. Oh well. I am not hearing back from my host, later finding her phone died. I would frequent the library and go between places in town, getting in a lot of small town walking throughout the day. At the library my credentials were expired. They had to go through hoops and hurdles to reactivate my card. I still have to sign on the library as a guest. I track a friend living here and hear from him he’s going to Jackie O’s to watch the World Series. I go and cannot find him. I leave to walk towards Open Mic at the coffee house and run into a friend of mine who just came back from Standing Rock. She had been arrested and bailed out of jail. Women were subject to humiliating ordeals as strip search and being jailed in a dog kennel. She and Prince were gathering the troops for a serious gathering and decolonized space. I had a dream before coming that the first thing I’d run into in Ohio would be an opportunity to go to Standing Rock. There is a caravan leaving this weekend. I have my learning plan jam this weekend and can do that by phone. I’m going to the Dakota Access Pipeline Encampments. 

  

I didn't post all my journal entries from last year. Like if you want to keep posted to the rest.

11/27/2016 - Donor Run Throwback

Hi Facebook. Checking in from Akron, Ohio. I hope you had a good Thanksgiving. I’m catching a ride soon up to Standing Rock. I feel called to serve and be of support as Winter comes. What solidified this in my conscious was the young girl whose arm was blown off by a concussion grenade a week ago. She was attempting to rescue a blacked out individual who got shot in the head by a rubber bullet. I cannot sit by as a spectator.

It will be camping in sub-zero cold. I’m looking to be as self-sufficient as possible. I’m almost fully Winterized. I’d like to get good winter boots & waterproof pants before I get there. Unsure as of now how much food is there, so I'd like to be prepared to feed myself and contribute evenly to gasoline. Thank you to everybody who opened their home up to me since I left. Thank you to past travel donors. Have a wonderful holiday season. Water is life, and it is our collective responsibility to stop all pipelines and gas infrastructure.

  
  

11/28/16 White Jesus Is Not Coming

Our caravan left from Cleveland this morning and we’re driving fourteen hours today. There is forecast for blizzard weather and 10F lows in Mandan tomorrow. We will be stopping in St. Paul, Minnesota tonight, and have about six hours before hitting the North Dakota border.

An unnamed friend donated $54.55 to my presence at Standing Rock. Fuel. Hotel. Food. Whatever. He had a string attached. He wants me to recruit for his organization’s inaugural street march at Standing Rock. This is an anomaly. Standing Rock is not a platform to organize, recruit, or evangelize. Standing Rock is an Indigenous-led prayer and resistance encampment. Native history in the US is riddled with this sort of toxic 'help' and it would be in bad taste for me to honor this request.

I will be talking to and engaging people, hopefully documenting stories. I’m not a journalist and the purpose is not publicity. I suppose deep down, I am going to Standing Rock to listen. There has been a lot of trauma, both historically, and in the last few months between Natives and non-Natives, and the least I can do is go and be emotional support. I’m not there to serve a donor, and I’m committed to not repeating historical pains there. Not time nor place to engage in movement colonizing.

  
  

11/29/16 10:30 PM Winter is Coming

Approaching the border to North Dakota, we hit the blizzard. Driving at a steady pace of 15 miles per hour, to avoid skidding on ice, seeing a few feet beyond the headlights, afraid the wind will blow us off the road. A few thousand people are camping in this storm. Many of them cannot leave. There is one hotel, twenty miles down, that can shelter the three of us for sixty five dollars. We’re in ground communication with a group there that is asking us to secure tire chains. A local advisory requests locals to report suspicious behavior to police. 

  

We are considering filing a suspicious behavior report regarding the governor, and about rogue groups in militarized uniform with semi-automatic guns, engaged in violent activity against a weaponless and sober prayer camp on ancestral land. Tear gas and rubber bullets aimed at faces smells foul play.. High pressure water cannons being used in 26 degree night. Can you file a suspicious behavior report on a multinational corporation? A young medic’s arm was blown off by a concussion grenade for heaven sake. Supply trucks are being fined and arrested to assist the ‘starvation by attrition’ effort. Chemical warfare is alleged through aircraft spray, marked by a strange non-viral cough.

Going off grid for the weekend. Will continue publishing these after Sunday.

11/30 "This is not fun!"

Checking in from Steele, North Dakota. Tuesday. 9:10 P.M. We were driving through snow storm emergency advisory. 30 MPH Winds. Nearly driven off road. Atrocious. Forty miles to Bismarck. One car has 4WD the other does not. Window slightly broken, always crack open.. Constant gusts of frost making white noise when driving. Embark in AM in light time. I got cold bug onset right before leaving. Purging lungs with expectorants to avoid sickness and infection. No symptoms except snot. Almost out of my system.

Tom got minor frostbite in his toe and had to go to the ER. He's been serving as a medic for months. In his words, "This is not fun!" Instead of going to camp, we got a hotel room and picked Tom up from this hospital. We are forcing him to rest for a day instead of returning. Many there plan to be there to death. I'm ready to potentially die out here. I can't live with myself sitting out longer. Some are there for free food and pushing the limits on the sobriety policy. Someone I know was spotted wasted at the local casino. This is really heavy work.

28 Degrees tonight. High of the week. Low is -7 next Wednesday.. I am not a novice at this. I’m not even there and I can say. Unless you are prepared for a Dakota Winter, don’t come. Do something meaningful from home. We are fine. This is not first rodeo.

Going off grid for the weekend. Will continue publishing these after Sunday.


  

 -Should we have expected police to pull us over on route? No laws being broken, but act of going is contentous to power. No pullovers. We we’re ready to conduct ourselves respectfully to authority. I had my lawyers hotline on speeddial. Not everybody is afforded those options in law enforcement encounters. 

  

Considering consolidating. Motel until advisory lets up this evening when advisory ends. Two bed one floor. Advisory says dangerous and travel should only happen in emergency. 

  

___________________________________

I recently commemorated the seven year anniversary of a near death experience which bestowed a morbid fear of the deep cold onto me. In the seven years since I have overcome agoraphobia, learned to sleep outside in cold weather, completed an 8 month cross country walk involving immersion in cold mountain environments, lived in a car over two Winter seasons and camped at Standing Rock in temperature lows of -18 degrees. If you are wondering whether that’s fahrenheit or celsius, it doesn’t matter, both merge at -40. Part of my participation at Standing Rock was confronting a deep fear which had many times paralyzed me into panic anxiety. 

  

12/5 'Hell is a Cold Tipi'

Canadian arctic blizzard from the Tundra a few hundred miles north. Today is resisting extreme weather conditions. Arctic winds pass regularly and can drop the temperature forty degrees in an hour. I'm prepared as best as I can.. Never done this before, and gear donations in camp help: Non-wool thermal Socks(I'm allergic to wool), a balaclava for my face, ski goggles to keep my eyelids from freezing.. exposed skin will freeze. My facial hair freezes in a minute of being outside.

I am okay. I am here and calm. I am learning. Six years ago I was terrified of suffocating in the extreme cold. Facing that fear for good. Difference between being in the cold, and being cold. Big difference. Next three days forecast calling for -18 with wind chill. WHEEEWW. If you are wondering whether that’s F/C, I forget and it doesn’t matter, both merge at -40.

Practically I knew to expect this, but had no context of experience. Many guests are unprepared, including many natives not from regions this cold. Most likely time to freeze is making bathroom treks during sleepy time.

Worst of all, the John trucks can’t suck up all the frozen septic poop, which fills to the top. Each septic toilet is a mountain of cholera. Composting toilet installation very soon, but in transition, nowhere to go #2. ‘Hell is a cold Tipi.’ I’m working in the emotional wellness Tipi. We’re in hell right now. I feel calm, and pretty fantastic. At least in hell I can laugh at myself.

  
  

12/7 Day 3 of negative degrees. Port-a-johns frozen through. Vacuum trucks can't empty facilities. New place anxiety = muscles tensing up down there blocking internal plumbing. Cannabis directly helps me with that. Oceti: No alcohol. No drugs. I respect that and leave that behind. It took me three days from arriving to get comfortable to chuck a football. By day 6 the johns were filled sky high to public sanitation risk. Either drive to the Rec center, or hold it in. I was doing shifts at the emotional wellness tipi. Couldn't be bothered to catch a ride to the rec center. Chose the hold it in till the next morning option. Intentionally stopped putting matter into my body. Was an unsustainable plan. Someone hinted johns at far end of camp were still good. Geared up for cold. I'm used to being terrified of extreme cold. At this point it's just an arctic venture. People might be doing physical labor outside who are more acclimated. This was a big plunge for me. No pun. Are the portajohns not serviced cause the governor threatens to fine companies helping? Or cause of the blizzard? I use medical cannabis for digestive flow. Relaxing butt muscles. This is a clean camp, no drugs or alcohol. I respect and honor that. It took me three days to poop. Now that is out of the way the port-a-johns are filled to capacity. No correlation. Composting toilets are soon to be implemented for that reason and that in this weather it all freezes making the septa fluid useless and cholera inevitable. Rumored Stories: Somebody got hypothermia going to the bathroom. Cannot get them to hospital because of snow.

  

12/6 I have been serving as a wellness provider. Active listening to people who need it. Hold space for people who  need to freak out and vent emotions. Team of 12. One Tipi and two Yurts. In this weather I cannot do much else than listen and be a burden on resources and a liability being inexperienced with arctic cold. It’s mostly winterized in there. The door has been floppy. The first night one of the other residents woke up to the door having been blown open by extreme gusts. Snow had been circulating everywhere through the wind. The wood burner was out. The emergency propane heater was out of propane. There was wood 8 feet outside the door. Someone was outside on medic guard and able to help. I’m sad they didn’t wake me up, but am glad they got the burner going. Since the door got fixed it’s been consistently warmer the past two days in the Tipi. The wind blows strong, but we are in time tested ancient engineering. In this time many people, especially non-native guests to the region who are unprepared for this weather have been freaking out and unable to leave due to blizzard conditions. I have had no fear. I have been calm and staying warm and providing emotional counsel to whoever comes in. I have to leave. I was planning on being here a month. I cannot be a drain on resources, a burden, and a liability. I can find ways of being of service back home. I am a stranger in a strange land here. 

Thousands of years of survival and five hundred years of resistance to colonial genocide. Any good idea out there has probably already been thought of, implemented, and improved upon.  

I do not think the drilling machinery of Energy Transfer will be able to operate in these sorts of conditions. The fight is far from over. Please be vigilant and support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other First Nations in this fight. 

Standing Rock was an Indigenous Prayer Resistance Camp. No one was armed. There are no drugs and alcohol allowed there. The ground we were on held the buried ancestors of the Sioux there. I and many others shared the perception that among fighting a pipeline, this was a portal opening to the spirit realm to change our collective course. Ancient ways of living were being revived. There were permanent residents, and people coming from hours away to receive healthcare and medical services. The medic operation was better staffed in diversity of vocational experience than the hospital in Bismarck. Fresh food was being brought in and distributed to the reservation there. A school was built there for the children and native language revitalizations were a hot topic. Yet everybody spoke English, militarized counter-resistance from the police and army were a constant, and the presence of white people was a necessity to keep efforts from turning into a historical repeat of Wounded Knee, where 150 Native Americans were massacred by the US Government on Pine Ridge reservation in 1890.  Very multidimensional and difficult to convey without direct bearing of witness.

An eviction notice was delivered for the 4th of December, with ambiguity meant to cultivate fear of violence. The Army approved live ammunition for use in that eviction notice. To counter that state sanctioned terrorism, thousands of people made their way up to Standing Rock to deliver a clear message that we were not backing down. The Dakota Access Pipeline(DAPL) violated historical treaties with the Sioux nation, such as the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, which guaranteed Lakota ownership of the sacred Black Hills, as well as the land Standing Rock was on. The US Government has attempted multiple times since to purchase the Black Hills for large sums of money, and has framed the Black Hills as a National Park. Instead of speaking for this conflict, I’m attaching an article to this post from Indian Country Media Network. I’ve learned from my experience that there are a ton of historical treatises(‘treaties’) between the US Government and Native American Tribes that have not been upheld, and if honored, would prevent pipeline projects like this from happening. Heck, if these agreements were actually honored, I think the empire would crash.  [https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/opinions/reclaiming-the-sacred-black-hills/](https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/opinions/reclaiming-the-sacred-black-hills/)

When the whole world was watching over social media, and thousands of people flocked to Standing Rock for ground support and protection, the eviction was backed down and not acted upon. There were acts of supply truck traffic being restricted into camp by police to starve the camps out by attrition. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

There’s a convenient gap in my journaling starting from arrival at Oceti Sakowin to the fifth of December. Photography was extremely restricted for various reasons. I have many shorter blurb memories. ---------

  

~Someone had an epileptic seizure in one of the dining areas. Everybody stopped what they were doing to ensure safety and wellbeing. Response of unity and benefit to the common welfare. Why can’t we respond to a political crisis the same way we respond to a medical crisis?

What is happening here is rooted in 500 years of indigenous resistance in this land and rooted in thousands of years of cultures, customs, traditions, and prayer. This could easily happen everywhere. This is the dawn of a new age. This is the dawn of decolonization. 

  
  

Raids have happened on the camp where police destroy shelters and take sacred objects and personal belongings and piss and shit on them. People are planning to stay here to the death. 

  

Locals do not have much money, but do take care of you. To not be taking advantage of the hospitality, it was suggested strongly, to be prepared and as self-sufficient as you can be. So much food and gear was coming in, that was never an issue. There were communal sleeping spaces that were dry and warm. One was a giant geodesic dome donated by Burning Man. Large events were hosted in that dome, sometimes till late.  Those events take higher priority over the sleeping space status. I am not a latebird when camping. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

In the mirror, Let it be seen, A reflection of, Your truth and being.

  

I’m going to set a time when I get back, to forgo my abstainance of alcohol, get plastered, have a print out of all my contacts, and do some 1 AM texting. 

  

I would love that. I'm heading out to walk my beast and then to work.  Nights work for me. My boys (I work with folks with disabilities in a residential setting)will be in bed around 10.  319-558-7721.

  

Ben. Got your message. Good to know you were in a Tp surviving below freezing temperatures, like a rebel  in Hoth.  
  
Things are shifting here. I am both watching with an odd number of eyes the unfoldment of this energy that ripples from sacred land. Hahaha, I can only imagine at times what its like where you are up north. Lemme know if there is a lady hanging with a tiger and lion up there will ya? I want to get in contact with your druid friend. He is the only one i can inquire about druid magic.  
  
Stay warm in a Tp amigo, hang around those fires, and stare at those stars...because, you are somewhere very far in a place out of sight. The stars where you roam, are very very bright. No one can blind a man while in the dark, for those who are blind themselves cannot find our eyes. Awake stay awake now and forever. Like a fire, a wick in the deep web, we are connected by constellations. Some of us where we are cant see the stars, but we can feel our connection.

  

I Want to prove being a mushroom is insanely profitable.I knowit sounds batshit crazy but roll with it. I want to propagate spores by sharing thisbusiness framework in the hopes others will be mushrooms in their professional business casual life. We need the humans to do the budding of mushrooms to reclaim ecology from a burning climate. We need mushrooms to hdecompose the racist colonial monstrous economic empires which want to extract and attrition dissent. 

  

Hire me to be a care provider. Here are services I offer. I am asking for 18 dollars an hour but i largely appreciate more greatly the opportunity to serve you intimes of stagnancy, depression, and limbo. Help me get good at these things. I already have a good bit of practice under my belt. Hire me. We can do an interview over webcam phone or in person. I operate in Rockville, Montgomery County, DMV area, with my rates being cheapest by localvicinity and how much I need to travel. 

  

I had solicited donations to get there on my newsfeed and raised 400$. 160$ was a cash donation from a friend hosting me in Akron. 50$ was donated directly to Oceti Sakowin. When somebody donates to me, where does that money go? In short: Gas, Bus Tickets, Junk Food, & Chinese Buffets. I generally couchsurf or camp. In extreme conditions I may split on a cheap hotel. I’m an extremely low budget traveler. Organized hitchhiking and gypsy travel. And in the end it was the same type of munitions she made in the military that killed her brother on their own homeland.

The work of the camps has just begun. My personal work has just begun.I aimed to raise 250$ in order to get to Standing Rock safely and get back too. With followers generosity I raised 400$. This money was for travel costs of gas, food, and my personal participation in gearing up. I am humbled by followers generosity. I do not have an income. I am throwing $50 of that towards Oceti Sakowin camp.

  

Thank you so much, Ben. What a blessing it is for you to go. I just came back this morning and I wish I didn't have to leave. Although I'm cash poor at the moment, I'll ask my friend Eric if wouldn't mind contributing to your fund. When I have the extra money I will be more than happy to go. FYI... There is a decolinization meeting every day at 6pm in the dome. It's an experience I strongly encourage. The healing is palatable. I will reach out to my connections in the Rosebud camp, which is located on the other side of the river. They are needing help in anticipation of the eviction if the main camp. Blessings and safe travels, my friend.

  

Thank you for you your unabashed ministrations. You stood up for what you believed in. And it's very admirable to see that you're bringing, real world, first person views to life about issues that a lot of people are overlooking. I look forward to seeing your posts on your observations of the events that took place while you were there.  
Respect.

  


Dog bit someone’s face. Injured eye bad. 

Trump didn’t come out of nowhere. I am convinced if you went back in time to 1592 and m et Christopher Columbus he would be much like Trump. I think Trump is a reincarnate and his rise to the presidency marks the fall of something huge. If you want to give that administration a one finger saluteone way to do that is to support this transition. 

  

## Red Warrior: 'Fuck peace & love. Let's fuck some people up..'

Stories in the media about Standing Rock rarely reflect the conflicts that happen between water protectors. A Lakota friend of mine sent me a personal warning to heed caution with Red Warrior Camp. When I shared that with a caravan group I am a part of I created tension not knowing some of my friends who had already been were part of Red Warrior. Within Oceti lay a walled off camp where many of the protectors are primed more militantly towards direct action. Although that is a key component of what is happening at Standing Rock, many of the elders are prioritizing peace, deescalation, and safety. A 34 year old proclaimed ‘elder of the 7th generation’ calls for autonomy to be more militant and for the elders to get out of the way. The strategy of the larger Oceti has seemed to be conduct prayer and hold ourselves peacefully. Intergenerational conflicts on methodology. 

  

Tire chains are expensive. The two or three places we went to had nothing to offer. One told us tire chains are illegal in ND(lie). Our caravan of two cars had to leave behind their 2WD vehicle in a strange parking lot. We crammed gear and several hundred dollars worth of donations


What does success look like to me? Indigenous Centered.  Build a New Legacy.  Be of use. Bring it home. Emotional first aid. Being present. Listening. Holding Space. Not licensed therapists. Not practicing mental health. 

‘There’s a pretty girl behind every tree in North Dakota.’ ‘White Jesus is not coming.’

Please do not cultivate fearful prayer over my wellbeing here. 

I am accepting donations to enable me to be an efffective activist. I have been actively resisting employment forhe past four years. In the same way that followingorders was the defense of Holocaust Nazis, I think we are baking the planet by meansof jobs for the sake of employment. I want to be a mushroom when I grow up. I am using an OpenMasters format to become a professsional care provider. I believe in addition to producers and consumers, we need decomposers in our dominant economic paradigm. Recycling, repurposing, breaking matter down. Alchemizing value into our literal and analogous shit. Mushroom stuff. Magic mushrooms show clinical value in healing trauma, reframing mortality, and rewiring our habits. They are an interface species between life and death. When we die it is mushrooms that facilitate our decomposition back into the elements. Mushrooms are highly intelligentand spore myceliua networks deep into everything. A single cugic inch of soil in old growth forest contains 8 miles. Stamets. They are the neural network, the internet of the natural world. They propogate information. I want to use the internets power for good to help decompose peoples clutterinto meaning and facilitate the opening of doorsfor new chapters and transitions. 

I've never been to BM but I have been to Rainbows. I know they both are very well organized and an incredible feat of anarchistic solidarity and decentralized organizing. What I mean to say is that part of what colonialism looks like is Native Culture as a spectacle. BM is a spectacle. It's a celebration of arts. SR is waging pipeline resistance and it doesn't help to have people come making it into festival culture. Photography is deeply restricted for these reasons.
