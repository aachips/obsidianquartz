"To help address needs after Helene caused extensive damage to Swannanoa's grocery store, Buncombe County is opening a new Community Engagement Market to help fill the gap and support our community with access to fresh, healthy food—all for free.

Additionally, Buncombe County Health and Human Services Department’s mobile health unit will also be there offering wellness checks, free vaccinations, and more. The Swannanoa market will be held on the first Monday of the month from 4:30-6 p.m. outdoors at the Asheville Christian Academy.

Grand Opening: Monday, April 7 | 4:30–6 p.m. Asheville Christian Academy gravel lot – 74 Riverwood Road, Swannanoa

Come shop for free, connect with your neighbors, and be part of something rooted in care and resilience.

Community Engagement Markets are open to all and held across Buncombe County.

(Note: Dates and times may vary due to weather or holidays.)"

I don't like letting my family live in my head rent-free.

We're experiencing wildfires all over from all the brush from the storm. It's very dry here and we only started to get rain again. If I die in a fire or lose where I live.
