Every teenager deserves to feel safe, respected, and supported within their family. This Bill of Rights outlines the important rights you have as a fifteen-year-old to foster a healthy and positive home environment.

- I have the right to maintain a loving relationship with parents, family, and friends that I choose, free from negativity or manipulation.
- I have the right to express myself respectfully without judgment or retaliation.
- I am responsible for my words and actions. I am not responsible for how others, including adults react. I can't control the actions of others, but I can choose how I respond.
- I have the right to reject and say no to family members if I am being harmed or treated poorly.
- My memories, experiences, and feelings, positive and negative, are valid and deserve respect. I have the right to express them without guilt.
- I have the right to feel safe and loved by my care provider, regardless of their relationship with each other.
- I am not responsible for managing the emotions or conflicts between my parents.
- I have the right to seek out medical or mental health support and treatments when I feel they are necessary for my well-being. I also have the right to participate in informed decision-making about my treatment plan, including the right to refuse a specific type of support or treatment that I don't feel comfortable with.
- I have the right to have my voice heard in discussions that impact my life.
- I have the right to ask for the truth on matters of concern from trusted adults in my life. 
- I have the right to a healthy and supportive environment where I can thrive.

Remember, you are not alone. If any of these rights are being violated, there are resources available to help. You deserve to have your voice heard and your needs met.
