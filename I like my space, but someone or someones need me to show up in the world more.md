I value my equilibrium and independence. I love being in my space in quiet, and don't crave leaving, or get the dreaded FOMO. I need time alone to process emotions. I've developed strong methods for maintaining my spiritual and emotional balance. I've retreated from past friendships to protect my energy, also due to past experiences.

In the past I have dealt with a lot of difficult people who deliberately misunderstand me and siphon my life energy away from me. Social interactions would leave me drained and felt obligatory, that after some time I didn't actually want them. As a result I have strong boundaries, and on some level fear losing my sense of self in relationships with others.

I know there are people in the world who desperately need my presence in their life. I know there is likely one or a few persons in particular wanting to connect. I may have signed into this situation way before I was born, knowing then what I was getting into. I know forming new connections will be different from past relationships.

I'm stable and secure in my peace, independence, and spirituality, and am not threatened by new connections. My strength and presence is needed by others in the world. This will bring mutual meaning and joy. I can maintain the leader role without being drained by old dynamics. The universe is gently guiding me towards these connections.
