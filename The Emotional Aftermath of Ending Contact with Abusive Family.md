Ending contact with an abusive family as the scapegoat can feel like the only way to breathe. You might naively assume the hard part is over. However, the reality for many is that a complex and often excruciating emotional aftermath awaits.The Initial Clarity and Its Pain

The realization that you've been the family scapegoat, experiencing systemic abuse fueled by unhealthy family dynamics, can be a shocking moment of clarity. It's like the twist ending of a movie, where the entire narrative you’ve lived feels false. Recognizing this distortion of your identity is the first step towards healing.Relief and the Inevitable Emotional Storm

Initially, ending contact can bring a sense of relief from constant triggers. However, this is often followed by a wave of complex emotions that need to be acknowledged and processed:

- Disenfranchised Grief: You may grieve the loss of connection with family members, even those who weren't direct abusers, and the loss of the ideal family you never had. This grief can be unrecognized by society and even mental health professionals, making it harder to navigate.
    
- Righteous Anger (Rage): Recognizing the profound injustices and twisted perceptions that defined your role can ignite intense anger. This anger is valid, especially when considering the impact on relationships with your own children, who might be turned against you.
    
- Guilt: Surprisingly, guilt can surface even when you know ending contact was necessary. This can stem from feeling responsible for the family's well-being, especially if you were conditioned to be the family empath.
    
- Depression: The initial energy of anger can dissipate, leaving you feeling disconnected, alone, and deeply depressed. It’s a potential bounce-back effect that requires understanding and support.
    
- Anxiety: Even without direct contact, triggers persist through reminders like birthdays and holidays. The primal part of our brain can interpret the severing of family ties as a threat, leading to heightened anxiety and feelings of vulnerability.
### Navigating the Aftermath

There's no quick fix, and recovery is a journey. Seeking support is crucial:

- Find a Therapist: Look for a therapist who understands family roles, scapegoating abuse, and complex trauma.
    
- Consider Trauma-Informed Coaching: Certified coaches with family systems training can also be helpful.
    
- Connect with Supportive Communities: Support forums can offer connection, but prioritize those focused on processing and healing, not just staying in anger.
    

Allow yourself to feel the spectrum of emotions. As the poem "The Guest House" by Rumi suggests, welcome all feelings, even the painful ones, as they can ultimately lead to healing and new joy. This is challenging work, but choosing your well-being is worth it.
