Every year, my birthday on July 31st holds a special significance. It's not just a personal marker of another year passing, but a historical one as well. This date, in 1492, marked the signing of the Alhambra Decree, a document that expelled all Jews from Spain. As a person raised with limited knowledge of Sephardic history, this realization ignited a passion to learn about this often-overlooked chapter in Jewish experience. Tonight's Shabbat dinner is dedicated to exploring that rich heritage, and I want to share some of the fascinating stories that weave together history, language, and resilience.

**A Flourishing Jewish Community in Spain**

Contrary to popular belief, the Jewish presence in Spain wasn't defined solely by persecution. For centuries, a vibrant Jewish community thrived on the Iberian Peninsula. They made significant contributions to Spanish society in the fields of science, philosophy, and the arts. The rise of Islamic rule in the 8th century ushered in a period of relative tolerance known as Al-Andalus. While not without its complexities and internal conflicts, this era fostered a remarkable exchange of ideas and cultural flourishing for Jews, Muslims, and Christians alike.

**The Rise of Intolerance**

The 15th century marked a shift in fortunes for Spanish Jews. The Catholic Church's reconquest of the peninsula led to increased restrictions and persecution. Many Jews were forced to convert to Christianity, becoming known as Conversos. The establishment of the Spanish Inquisition in 1478 further intensified the climate of fear. This religious tribunal primarily targeted Conversos suspected of secretly practicing Judaism, subjecting them to brutal interrogations and punishments.

**The Expulsion and Diaspora**

The Alhambra Decree of 1492 delivered a devastating blow. Facing forced conversion or expulsion, hundreds of thousands of Jews were uprooted from their homes in Spain. This event, along with the earlier Alhambra Edict, triggered a mass exodus known as the Sephardic Diaspora. Sephardic Jews scattered across North Africa, the Middle East, and even the Americas, carrying with them their rich traditions and a deep sense of loss.

**Ladino: A Legacy of Resilience**

In the midst of displacement, a unique language emerged â€“ Ladino. This Judeo-Spanish dialect blended Hebrew and Arabic influences with Castilian Spanish, the language spoken in Spain. Ladino served as a powerful tool for Sephardic Jews to preserve their cultural identity and heritage across vast geographical distances. It's a testament to the human spirit's ability to adapt and find solace in the face of adversity.

**Crypto-Jews and the New World**

The story doesn't end there. Many Conversos, fearing further persecution, fled to the Americas while maintaining their Jewish practices in secret. These "Crypto-Jews," or Anusim, faced the constant threat of exposure. Their descendants, often unaware of their Jewish lineage, carry the echoes of this hidden history.

**Seeking Reconciliation**

In a recent attempt to acknowledge this painful past, the Spanish government has offered a path to citizenship for Sephardic descendants who can prove their lineage. While challenges remain in documenting this often-concealed heritage, this gesture represents a step towards reconciliation.

**Conclusion**

Tonight's Shabbat dinner is a tribute to the enduring legacy of Sephardic Jews. As we gather around the table and share a meal infused with Ladino influences, we remember the expulsion, the resilience of a people, and the enduring spirit of tradition. This journey of discovery has enriched my understanding of Jewish identity and compels me to continue learning about this remarkable chapter in history.

This upcoming Saturday, I will be hosting some company for Shabbat Dinner. If you are reading this, you are likely going to be there!

One of my favorite and most effective ways to deal with stress is to plan a nice meal event. So thank you for making this possible.

I made this post to share the tentative menu, and propose a bit of a game out of it.

Here is the game: The menu items are in Ladino. I'm posting a version of the menu without translations or dish descriptions. See if you can figure out what is being served. If you figure out the answers, or think you know, don't tell the other participants. Use a search engine if you want. It may or may not help.

## What is Ladino?

[Ladino is a very old form of Spanish spoken by the diasporic Jewish exiled from Spain in 1492](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ladino/). Prior to the Spanish Inquisition, Spain was under Islamic rule in the age of Al-Andalus. Over this time, Jews, Muslims, and Christians lived among each other in an age of enlightenment and prosperity for over eight hundred years. Over the Sephardic Diaspora, Judeo-Spanish was spread all over the Mediterranean, particularly to the Ottoman Empire (mainly Turkey & Greece) where we were given refuge and asylum. Many Jews stayed in Spain, feigned conversion to Christianity, and forged blood documents to go to the New World. These families had to live in complete secrecy of being Jewish. They couldn't tell their children they were Jewish (children are bad at keeping secrets). But they could preserve bits and pieces of their culture into Christian rituals and practices. The Spanish Inquisition lasted as an institution for over three hundred years. That entire time, it was not safe to practice Judaism in Spanish colonies openly. The most documented form of Ladino available online and in written historical documents is from Turkey. The Ladino that existed in Latin and South America was diluted with the Spanish that was more widely spoken. Keep in mind, [Mexico was much larger prior to 1844](https://mapoftheday.quickworld.com/posts/mexico-in-1844). Spanish colonized territory included land we recognize today as New Mexico, going all the way up to Wyoming. So you may find Crypto-Jewish households and families who may or may not be aware of their family's history, all the way from Wyoming to Chile. The documented Ladino is primarily that spoken today in Turkey. It is different from the bits of Ladino you may find traces of in the Americas today.
