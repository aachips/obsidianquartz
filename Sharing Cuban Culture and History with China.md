¨Even in darkness we celebrate Christmas¨**

¨The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, on them a light has shined.¨     Isaiah 9:2  
  
I have been thinking for some time about how to write a Christmas message proclaiming hope. This has been a difficult year for Cubans, including those who are with us today. This Christmas time invites us not to lose that faith with which Jesus taught us in his life in the middle of the road. A hope that invites us to follow that space of faith in knowing that everything can be different. Let us not allow the shortcomings and situations that affect our lives to prevent us from celebrating the advent and birth of the child who changed the course of history. Be people who bring joy to the hearts of those who suffer, of those who suffer without a sense of their own for which they will exist. Let us be part of the life of Jesus. The announcement of the birth in the midst of darkness is the proof that one can follow the path of hope based on Faith. Today we proclaim the tenderness of God. The world keeps moving, human beings continue to search for God, but the sign is still this one. Jesus is born at night and in the darkness we announce that hope becomes reality in the midst of difficulties.  
  
We only show that path of peace in the midst of the storm. Where we can be capable of facing problems. Because we are a people who walk in darkness and saw a great light. That clarity of each dawn with the news of hope made reality in the midst of the challenges of the time. Let us not let that smile fall that helps compete with the sadness that abounds in these times. We only affirm that Jesus is born because we are still that people who walk.  
  
For next year we let you know that we do not know how it will be. But we affirm that God walks beside those who suffer and where the Sun sets we know that we can get there but first we have to find the path of Hope.  
   
May the God of new opportunities continue to bless you.

During a recent trip to Cuba, I observed a unique opportunity for cultural and economic exchange between Cuba, China, and the broader BRICS alliance. This idea stems from a digital rebellion happening in the U.S., where young people are migrating from TikTok to Chinese platforms like Red Note (or Redbook) amid the U.S. government’s efforts to ban TikTok.

### The TikTok Ban and the Shift to Red Note

- TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform popular in the U.S., faces a ban due to concerns about its influence on youth organizing.
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram) lobbied for the ban, hoping to reclaim users, but many are instead migrating to Red Note, the Chinese version of TikTok.
- Red Note’s primary language is Mandarin, but its users are welcoming and eager for cross-cultural exchange.
### Opportunity for Cuba

1. **Cultural Exchange:**
    
    - Chinese users on Red Note are keen to learn Spanish and connect with Spanish speakers.
        
    - Cubans could create TikTok-style content about Cuban history, culture, and language, resonating with Chinese audiences.
        
2. **Economic and Infrastructural Support:**
    
    - BRICS nations (including China) are challenging IMF/Western financial dominance and offering debt relief.
        
    - Closer ties with China could bring Cuba infrastructural support, such as hospital construction, rather than the exploitative practices often associated with Western institutions.
        

### Why This Matters

- The U.S. government has long demonized China and Cuba, but grassroots digital connections are breaking these barriers.
    
- Young Americans on Red Note are learning Mandarin and forming bonds with Chinese users—a model Cubans could replicate to foster solidarity and economic collaboration.
    

**Call to Action:**  
Cubans, especially Spanish speakers or students, could leverage Red Note to:

- Share Cuban culture and history.
    
- Teach Spanish to Mandarin speakers.
    
- Explore paid tutoring opportunities.
    

This could pave the way for deeper Cuba-BRICS ties, offering an alternative to Western economic pressures.
