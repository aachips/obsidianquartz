Help a chip off the old block get their business off the ground..

Every cold season for the past six years I have made apple chips. Most of these are given out for free, many of them are sold. In the off-season, I work on the administration and side projects. Sometimes I pick up private cooking jobs. My part time job, which eats up all of my energy, is teaching, is 18 hours a week. I have bills, aspirations, and people and places I wish to support. Here are some ways you can be the wind beneath my wings..

+ I have a [[Wishlist]]. 
+ Buy bags of apple chips as pay-it-forward, to cover the expense of gifting free bags of apple chips to 
+ Donate directly to my <a href="https://www.paypal.me/bbushwick" target="_blank">Paypal</a>, or my <a href="https://www.ko-fi.com/aachips" target="_blank">Ko-Fi</a> campaign.
