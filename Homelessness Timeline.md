My journey took a significant turn around January 2017, when I reached a [[Pact and New Beginning|breaking point]]. I made the personal commitment that if things got bad enough, I would pack up and start anew in the mountains1. I severed contact with [[Family Relationships.md|my family]], specifically [[Family Relationships.md|my mother]], due to emotional barriers and conflicts2.... I felt her threat to report me as a missing person was an attempt to control me, not genuine concern, and I chose to set firm boundaries2. Around early 2017, it became dangerous for me to stay in my hometown, partly because I had a falling out with [[Family Relationships.md|my mother]] and she threatened a wellness check, which is very risky when living in your car4. I also felt emotionally scarred and lacked trust in her5.

I followed through with my pact on January 27, 2017, cutting ties and driving south for eight hours in my spacious car, which then became my shelter1. I was [[Living in my Car.md|homeless in a new town]] for three years1. [[Homelessness.md|Living in a car]] can take many forms; it’s not always the stereotype of someone begging on the sidewalk4.... For me, it became my [[Car-Partment.md|car-partment]], a refuge and a place to keep my essentials7....

Life in my car came with challenges. I quickly learned about the lack of [[Living in SUV Means no Indoor Plumbing|indoor plumbing]] and relying on public facilities9.... Car maintenance also became a crucial, and often stressful, part of survival7.... In [[2017 what a year#April 2017|April 2017]], my car was towed three times, requiring arrangements and payments to get it back12. Later, in [[2017 what a year#November 2017|November 2017]], I detailed the numerous auto repairs I needed to focus on, like ordering tie rods, replacing ball joints, and adjusting suspension13. The car also had recurring battery issues, likely from a starter problem, and [[Anne 2018.md|Benjamin]] jump-started it for me multiple times14. Beyond maintenance, ensuring safety while sleeping in the car was a constant concern, especially with a broken window at one point14.

Despite the difficulties, living in my car also offered a degree of freedom and personal space15.... It allowed me to escape toxic situations and find a path to recovery that, while seemingly illogical to some, made sense to me17.... It aligned my sleep with the sun and offered a sanctuary for thought and writing15.... I even found comfort in the rain on the roof15.

During these years, I became deeply involved with the [[Free Meals and Community.md|free meal programs]] in the area19.... I volunteered at places like [[Kairos Center.md|Kairos Center]] and [[AHOPE.md|AHOPE]]14.... These meals were a crucial source of food19..., but also an opportunity to connect with people experiencing similar circumstances21.... I believe in [[Cultivating Community and Solidarity|extending a hand of companionship]] by joining these meals, not just as a volunteer, but as someone seeking connection and understanding22.... This experience taught me a lot about the diverse realities of homelessness4... and the importance of solidarity28.

I met many individuals, each with their own story. There was [[Anne 2018.md|Anne]], who struggled with finding housing and seemed resistant to help, though her dog Maya was a major concern for the community14.... I also encountered [[The Ingles Guy.md|the Ingles Guy]], an old Black man who stayed near where I parked and refused to eat at a local free meal because it was run by lesbians, highlighting how personal beliefs can impact access to resources23.... Meeting [[A Black Family got locked out of their Vehicle at Ingles this Morning.md|Glen and Brenda]] at Ingles, who were locked out of their car, reminded me of my own past struggles and the kindness of strangers31. Brenda shared the heartbreaking story of their son [[A Black Family got locked out of their Vehicle at Ingles this Morning.md|Kyri]], who was murdered, starkly illustrating the injustices faced by people of color32.

These experiences fueled my commitment to advocacy. I participated in actions like the [[2017 what a year#2017 What a weird year|Fight for $15 disruption]]33. I learned about [[Antifa and Mutual Aid.md|mutual aid groups]] that provided vital support like free meals, clothing, healthcare connections, and even bootlegging medications like insulin34.... These groups felt more like superheroes fighting evil and protecting the vulnerable than the media narrative portrayed39. They saved my life during a time when I was hiding my sexuality and living in my car34....

I also faced significant [[Physical and Mental Health.md|personal health challenges]]. I experience chronic muscle and bone pain, exacerbated by a multi-car accident in [[Car Wreck with Mat.md|October 2019]] that likely caused whiplash40.... I live with [[Physical and Mental Health.md|PTSD]], particularly from crowds and loud noises, stemming from my activism18. I'm highly sensitive to environmental stimuli and can easily become overwhelmed, leading to mental overload and the potential for meltdowns42. I suspect I have a [[Physical and Mental Health.md|traumatic brain injury]] from multiple concussions while homeless43.

One of my most challenging struggles is with [[Communication Challenges.md|communication]]. I am an adult autistic, self-diagnosed, and have a history of learning disability44. Stress can cause [[Communication Challenges.md|mute episodes]] for days or weeks, making it physically and mentally anguish-inducing to speak3.... This difficulty has impacted relationships, job opportunities, and my ability to ask for help when I need it most3.... Being unable to talk in certain situations can be dangerous, for instance, during interactions with law enforcement43. I've learned to write, type, or use gestures, but many situations aren't accessible for nonverbal individuals43.

For years, I relied on a journaling keyboard, an [[Accessible Communication Tools.md|Alphasmart device]], which significantly changed my life for note-taking and journaling47.... When its keys broke, I realized how much I needed an [[Accessible Communication Tools.md|assistive device]], ideally one with [[Accessible Communication Tools.md|text-to-voice capability]]45.... These devices are incredibly expensive, and navigating insurance and specialists for this specific need, especially without a formal diagnosis, is difficult46.... I believe there should be greater acceptance of nonverbal communication and more accessible technology50. My personal experience with [[Communication Challenges.md|ghosting]] and neglecting communication, even with loved ones, stems from these struggles and feeling unworthy of connection when I'm tired3....

Beyond my personal struggles, I've encountered complex situations while trying to help others. For example, assisting a crack cocaine user experiencing [[Tim shits pants from bad crack.md|"cocaine shits"]] highlighted the need for accessible public restrooms and safer spaces for vulnerable individuals52.... This event also brought up reflections on privilege and how different people navigate dangerous situations57. I also had challenging experiences living with housemates, navigating drug use and paranoia, emphasizing the need for boundaries and protecting my space59....

My experiences have shown me the systemic issues that contribute to poverty and homelessness, such as predatory landlords36, lack of affordable housing14..., inadequate medical support for chronic conditions42, and the disproportionate impact of the legal system on marginalized communities32.... I've seen the potential of programs like the [[Continuum of Care.md|Continuum of Care]] to provide financial aid and gather data on barriers, but also the complexities of navigating these systems67. I believe in the right to self-determination, even for individuals making what others perceive as "bad decisions," unless they are legally deemed unable to make rational choices68....

My time [[Living in my Car.md|living out of my vehicle]] was also intertwined with navigating my identity. Although I didn't realize I was [[Trans Identity.md|transgender]] initially, I felt immense discomfort with my previous identity1. Coming out is dangerous, but denying my truth was profoundly miserable16. I am [[Trans Identity.md|trans, a woman in spirit]], and have always been16. Misgendering takes a heavy toll, and I constantly have to fight for my validation16. I'm acutely aware of the realities of sexual violence, patriarchy, and toxic masculinity that impact trans women16. Even in seemingly progressive spaces, bigotry exists71.

My life experiences, from [[Homelessness.md|houselessness]] and [[Living in my Car.md|living in my vehicle]] to navigating complex relationships and advocating for marginalized communities, have given me a unique perspective. I've learned the importance of connecting people to resources, advocating for systemic change, and fostering genuine human connection.

This journaling project, organized in markdown with interconnected notes like the ones linked above, is a way for me to process these experiences, share my story, and build a foundation for projects like Heartwarmers. It's about compiling the lessons learned from the streets, the free meals, the advocacy, and the personal struggles to create resources that truly meet people's needs. It’s about taking my life's documentation and turning it into something useful, like alchemy72. I care about people and their well-being73 and believe that my experiences have positioned me to make a difference in my community73.
