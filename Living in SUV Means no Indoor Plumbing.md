## July 2017

Living in my SUV means no indoor plumbing. It's comfortable but lacks a bathroom. A common experience among vehicle dwellers is waking up with an urgent need for a toilet, often triggered by the sunrise. Holding it until a proper restroom is available can be unpleasant, but it's a rite of passage for car campers. However, I've discovered a way to shift my "morning urgency": smoking pot. This can delay the need for anywhere from a minute to a couple of hours, as I experienced last night.

I simply want to live my life, though I don't have all the answers. Seeing organized Nazis in the streets of an American city, just six months into the new administration, was shocking. Stop, Focus, Listen. Yesterday's images undoubtedly disturbed many. Half of my family is Jewish, the other half includes white supremacists. My grandfather has sent bigoted chain emails since I was a child. My uncle and cousin actively share dangerous propaganda online. I've distanced myself from them and haven't spoken to my mother in eight months. While she isn't a Nazi, she remains close to my grandfather, who holds those views.

I believe in service without violence. Although I've never been in the military, I serve my country daily. Over the past five years, I've marched over 3,300 miles and spent more than 365 nights sleeping in various public spaces. I have PTSD from crowds, loud noises, and experiences ranging from de-escalating tense situations to encountering LRADs used by law enforcement. During this time, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology with Honors. I've traveled through over 30 states, connecting with people and communities and listening to their stories. My writing serves as a self-report for the FBI, which I call Statebook. This service has resulted in chronic physical and mental health issues, akin to battle trauma. I continue to serve by volunteering my time to feed the hungry in Asheville. I had a breakdown during J20, left everything, and cut contact with some family. I intentionally choose to live out of my vehicle rather than in an apartment. It's my path to recovery, which might seem illogical to some but makes perfect sense to others. I've encountered countless individuals who share a similar consciousness, characterized by a reverence for Indigenous values, the environment, and justice for the most vulnerable.
