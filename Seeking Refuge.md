Seeking refuge in Asheville from family abuse. Drawn to the clean mountain creek water. Intend to arrive respectfully and mindfully of local communities and gentrification. In need of shelter and work. Willing to do dishwashing, food preparation, and cooking. Available for household care. A practicing minimalist offering a free decluttering session. Can meal prep with provided supplies. Seeking shelter, food, money, or $20 in exchange for these services.

Concerned about unwanted psychiatric intervention. Experiencing hardship, not mental illness. Unemployment and worries about the future are understandable responses to current times, not symptoms of psychosis. The lack of housing is a societal problem. Do not want or need medication, psychiatric intervention, or to be reported for avoiding contact with my mother. Her fixation on potential tragedy is unhealthy. Trust in my resilience is needed. What appears as unusual spiritual experiences may be misinterpreted. While understanding her concerns, they are misdirected. Addressing the root of these concerns would require vulnerability and confronting difficult emotions. Scapegoating is easier than self-reflection.

My needs include: caring for others, understanding and friendship, a safe place to sleep (enough for a mat, books, and clothes), dignity and respect, paid work opportunities, a kitchen for cooking and nourishing others, clean natural water, a supportive and affectionate partner, a different environment, a cohesive community focused on Earth healing and ancient traditions, healthy plant-based food, relief from paternal judgment, self-determination, and freedom from a relapsed gaming addiction (requiring agency in my life). Also desiring an indoor hammock stand for restorative joy.
