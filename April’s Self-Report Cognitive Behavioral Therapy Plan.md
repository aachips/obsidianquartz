excerpt: Here's a self-report I made with a therapy plan while seeking out Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Background: Impacted by witnessing environmental damage in my early twenties, I dedicated myself to environmental activism, viewing jobs as the cause of climate change. This belief led me to avoid the workforce and created obstacles in my career. Simultaneously, I experienced significant, unaddressed health issues and was asked to leave my parents' homes, despite a childhood focused on minimizing individual carbon footprints. I also distanced myself from close relationships, prioritizing a perceived higher purpose over intimacy, and suppressed parts of my personality. Extensive travel built a network validating my choices, while my mother often overstepped my boundaries.

At 24, I moved to North Carolina, suffering from a severe, untreated dust mite allergy that made indoor living difficult. I had severed ties with family and a large extended network and concealed a lifelong disability due to shame for nearly 15 years. My father provided minimal monthly support. I had a pattern of pushing people away through online arguments and often went months without contacting loved ones. I volunteered at meal programs mainly for social interaction and food. Completing applications was challenging due to dysphoria and feelings of inauthenticity. Legally changing my name and gender marker took two years of pro-se work. I often worked in underpaid kitchen roles for social opportunities. My helpfulness led to repeat invitations and eventually running private dinner parties, where I excelled. However, declining physical health impacted my ability to work, and transitioning back into housing was difficult due to homelessness-related discrimination. I found some work providing in-home cooking workshops for disabled clients. My current aspiration is to develop a Kitchen-based Occupational Therapy practice for adults with disabilities and adolescents, focusing on independent living skills and fair compensation.

Present Situation & Goals: I have been stably housed for about three years and am proficient in independent living. Currently, I rely on parental financial support, which I aim to change. My goals are to avoid destitution and broken relationships, overcome avoidance of closeness, and improve communication of my needs and experiences. I am committed to self-work and believe Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can help.

Therapy Priorities (Spectrum Pillar Model): Due to verbal deficits and apraxia, this serves as a guide using my Spectrum pillar model (Developmental, Academic, Vocational, Social/Interpersonal, Independent Living, and Intimacy). My primary focus areas are Vocational and Intimacy.

- Vocational: I struggle with financial instability and maintaining employment, experiencing vocational depression due to repeated rejection and difficulty securing accommodations. While SSI is appealing, my career ambition is Kitchen-based Occupational Therapy. I am awaiting acceptance into a Peer Support Training program with Vaya. I frequently feel hopelessness and devaluation.
    
- Intimacy & Relationships: This is a secondary priority where I need support. My dating experiences have primarily involved single mothers where I often took on a transitional guardian role. As a gender-transitioning autistic adult, parenting is complex. I value children but do not want my own. I recognize my codependency and tendency to absorb others' struggles but am improving at setting boundaries. A past false accusation led to significant trust issues and years of abstaining from dating.
    
- Developmental: I have adult experience of Pervasive Developmental issues, including sensory sensitivities, need for solitude, aversion to social interaction, and disorganized patterns when overwhelmed. Diagnosed with Dysgraphia as a child, this is not a current focus. Adult traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) have also impacted daily functioning.
    
- Academic: I have been out of school for nearly a decade with no immediate plans to return. Past testing showed high aptitude in mental math, lower reading comprehension, and scattered writing. I struggled with organization and often retreated into video games, and was perceived as oppositional due to difficulty understanding authority. I have become skilled at record-keeping and can manage complex tasks with control over pacing and scheduling.
    
- Social & Interpersonal: I can connect with groups when desired but experience social deficits affecting friendships. I do not currently prioritize close friendships. My connection strategies include cooking, cleaning, sharing food, and sometimes conversation. Maintaining desired relationships is the challenge. I experience anxiety around birthdays and holidays and am often bored with conventional social interactions, primarily connecting with individuals with direct or generational experiences of genocide and war. I have ended many relationships based on moral principles and intentionally create distance to manage my life.
    
- Independent Living: Generally a strength with minimal support needed, primarily financial due to employment difficulties. Even while homeless, I maintained a livable car and have been housed for three years. My personal space tends to be cluttered but hygienically maintained, with a priority on kitchen cleanliness, meal preparation, personal hygiene, and safety. During depression, some areas may be neglected. My competence has led me to consider becoming a support specialist for other disabled adults, focusing on kitchen skills. Managing the hot season is challenging, and my goal is to acquire a work/recreational van for temporary living options before next spring.
