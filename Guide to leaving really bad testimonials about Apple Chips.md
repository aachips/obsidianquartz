Hello. I hope you enjoyed your apple chips. I have a small request. I am asking people to leave testimonials on the website about their chip experience.

But here’s the thing. When it’s positive testimonials. They are really boring. 

I am asking people I trust to leave really scathing bad testimonials blaming the apple chips for their problems.

I am imagining someone eating apple chips viewing the website and seeing a series of comically bad and baffling testimonies scapegoating the chips for various life problems.
#### The Rules:

- Be creative: Don't just say the apple chips are bad. Come up with an outlandish, humorous reason why they're the root of all your problems.
- Be specific: Instead of general complaints, pinpoint a specific life issue that the apple chips have caused. For example, "The apple chips made me miss my flight" or "The apple chips are why I forgot my anniversary."
- Keep it light-hearted: Remember, this is all in good fun! Avoid mean-spirited or hurtful comments.
- Use humor: Exaggerate, embellish, and have fun with it! The more ridiculous, the better.
#### Tips for Writing a Great Comically Bad Testimonial:

- Start with a dramatic opening sentence, like "It was the day I tried the apple chips that my life began to unravel...
- Use hyperbole to emphasize the "devastating" effects of the apple chips. For example, "I ate one bag of apple chips and suddenly my cat started ignoring me, my car broke down, and I lost my job."
- Make it personal. Share a (fake) story about how the apple chips affected you or someone you know.
- Use clever wordplay and witty language to add to the humor.
#### Example Testimonials to Get You Started:

- "I ate the apple chips and suddenly my dog started barking at the mailman. Coincidence? I think not."
- "The apple chips are why I forgot my wedding vows. True story."
- "I blame the apple chips for my recent tax audit. It's the only logical explanation."
