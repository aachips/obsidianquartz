**"The Last Hooraw:  "** 

Tuesday Evening. This feels like a sitcom gone horribly wrong. I come home to the doors wide open. Linzee is there. They have a guest. They are up in the bedroom. When they have company, it makes things worse. It always takes a nosedive when they have an audience-- like they are trying to prove something. One minute they are laughing together, the next minute, Linz darts out of the bedroom to the bathroom and all I hear is the sound of projectile vomiting and gut fart implosions. 

It's two days before they are leaving, and all that is fixated in my mind is that they have Norovirus. If you have never had Noro, consider yourself lucky. It's a miserable 3-5 days of high pressure bursts from both ends. Resting for 20 minutes on the bathroom floor with gut pain so intense, that death doesn't seem too bad. I had it once while I was unhoused in 2018 around Christmas time. But I had a home stay to go to weather it out. The dread of not knowing if you will be able to show up to work next week, while on a very tight wage salary. Knowing how extremely contagious it is, even if you go to battle with the Clorox wipes, gloves, and face mask. And I did. In between their bathroom trips. Four times that evening. 

But in between, they were laughing and having fun together. So it's probably alcohol and drugs. I never had that type of problem with substances, but even when my life was centered around intoxication, things like this you don't miss. At all. Whenever drinking around other people, I'd always end up assuming the role of the party Dad or Mom, cleaning up a disgusting mess, or caring for someone with alcohol poisoning. 

I actually don't care if they choose to drink. It's the stimulants that bother me. Linzee was unhoused for years, and used meth to stay awake and stay safe. When they would have no one to turn to to vent their problems, their dealer would find them and listen, at the price of putting a needle in their arm. 

I hate meth. I have seen what it does to people. It does not bring out the best in those who use it. And yet, in the mountains, it has an allure to it. If you have to work long hours to feed your kids, getting through an 18 hour day of manual labor is much easier for a time with it. I like to look at substance abuse as a way to see problems with your society. In the United States, many are overworked and abused by their jobs, and the lower you go on the rung, the more physically demanding that work is. 

I'm not fond of alcohol either. I don't like being around intoxicated people. I have been substance free for the past year and a half, mostly out of spite. 

I find out the next morning their friend was Phillip. A friend and unhoused man staying in the shelters during Code Purple. I said you can host Phillip during one of these code purple nights in the living room, but the empty bedroom is off limits. Someone still holds that room on the lease and pays rent for it. I said it's not available for subletting and I am not trying to take in another unhoused person. Despite it being a kind thing to do, I need to protect my space and myself. I already got one feral person in my space on my hands.

I politely shared to them that, despite what they may have been told, the room isn’t available, and to their credit, they’re super kind about it. They leave, probably thinking their friend is a liar. I don’t blame them.


But let’s be real—this is also the same person who accused me of poisoning their coffee because I’m supposedly HIV+. (Spoiler: I’m not.) They’ve called the police on me, claimed I was attacking them, and generally made my life a roller coaster the past month. They say I am scary. I'll take it. 

Discord is my lifeline tonight:

**Me:** They’re terrified of me, and I’m not even trying.  
**Robert:** What a disappointing outcome. You were legit trying to help this person, and now you’re their enemy because of their mental illness.  
**Me:** Yep. I’ve literally done nothing to them except clean the house, accommodate their weird requests, and offer support.  
**Sydney:** Drugs, y’know.  Tweakers are really annoying.
**Me:** You know how I say I’m married to a ghost? Well, I’ve got spirits around me that aren’t as nice as I am. I call them the in-laws.

We’re all laughing, but there’s a bittersweet edge to it. This person is clearly struggling, but their chaos has become my burden. And yet, I can’t help but feel a twinge of pity. They’re shooting themselves in the foot, and I don’t need to help.

As the night winds down, I’m left with one thought: I just want this to end gracefully.
