Once upon a time, a nomadic witch with no permanent home traveled from place to place. This kind witch quietly brought blessings of joy and prosperity through their kitchen magic, despite lacking a kitchen of their own.

Long ago, the witch resided in a cozy shelter nestled within the woods. The heart of this dwelling was a magnificent kitchen, the most beautiful imaginable. All the woodland creatures knew to visit the witch's kitchen, where every visitor was fed. The meals were prepared with the freshest, most flavorful ingredients: vibrant plants, fragrant herbs, wholesome grains, nutritious legumes, crunchy nuts, sweet fruits, and garden-fresh vegetables, all enhanced with rich oils and fats derived from the same bounty. Meat was never served in this kitchen; instead, every meal was a celebration, a time for creatures to eat together in harmony, fostering peace throughout the forest for a long time.

However, a curious man from Babylon arrived to investigate the commotion. Unsure of the festive gatherings, he anonymously contacted the food department, which dispatched a food inspector. The inspector, while acknowledging the kitchen's cleanliness and adherence to regulations, stated that keeping mice on the premises was not permissible. The witch pleaded that the mice were part of their community, but the inspector insisted on the rules. Tragically, the kitchen then caught fire and burned down, leaving no one harmed but also no kitchen remaining.

Undaunted, the resilient witch didn't dwell on the loss. Now free to wander, the witch, who enjoyed walking, decided to embark on a journey. Walking became a daily rhythm, taking the witch to towns and places they would never have visited otherwise. Being a good people person, the witch was welcomed as a pilgrim and treated with exceptional hospitality everywhere they went. No one suspected the witch's true nature; they were simply seen as a pleasant and welcoming guest. In each temporary home, the witch found opportunities to cook for the host family, clean dishes, and prepare remedies. This arrangement suited the witch well while they were on the move. However, the constant walking eventually became tiring, and the witch longed for sustained generosity. Gradually, people became less open. The witch eventually found themselves lost in an unfamiliar city, without acquaintances or direction.
