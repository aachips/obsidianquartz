## My Reading Journey

I once loved reading—books, online content, publications—anything that sparked my curiosity. On pleasant days, I'd find a shaded spot in the park and lose myself in pages of knowledge.

That changed after a series of traumatic brain injuries. Multiple incidents—from physical assaults to pedestrian bike accidents—left me with lasting cognitive challenges. Now, dense blocks of text present a genuine barrier to my learning.

## The New Reality

My relationship with reading has fundamentally changed:

- Loud noises, crowds, and confrontational situations trigger mental breakdowns
- Processing long text passages has become significantly more difficult
- Traditional textbooks represent both a physical and cognitive burden

This isn't about devaluing literacy—it's about recognizing diverse learning needs in our digital age.

## Beyond the Financial Burden

While cost is often discussed (and rightfully so), my concern extends beyond money:

- I don't want bulky, heavy books occupying my limited space
- The physical presence of books I struggle to read becomes a constant reminder of my limitations
- For materials I'll only reference once or twice, purchasing a full textbook is wasteful

## Practical Alternatives for Educators

Instead of mandatory textbook purchases, consider:

1. **Require texts with e-book options** - Digital formats work with screen readers and accessibility tools
2. **Share essential excerpts** - If only specific sections are needed, provide digital copies of those pages
3. **Embrace student-discovered resources** - Students often find excellent open-source materials that explain concepts in beginner-friendly ways
4. **Create accessible assignment prompts** - Don't tie assignments to specific textbook pages without providing alternatives
5. **Remember accessibility is equity** - Required textbooks can create barriers for first-generation students, those with disabilities, and those facing financial hardships

## A Simple Request

You don't need to announce that textbooks are optional. Just provide alternative pathways for students who face barriers—whether financial, physical, or cognitive.

The future of education isn't about abandoning valuable resources—it's about making knowledge accessible to everyone, regardless of their circumstances.
