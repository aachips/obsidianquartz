We don't need to get along. We don't need to talk or like each other as people. 

+ Bind on family doing harm.
+ Make a page that shares my story.
+ Do so that is honest, vulnerable, and safe.
+ Include pictures, documents, and receipts whenever possible. You need not share this on the web page. But have it organized on the back-end.
+ Be intentional about what you wish to share and what you do not. [[Make a list of what to share]].
+ [[Write a birthday card to all the kids whose lives I have been in.]]
+ [[Make a list of people you wish to leave a card for their kid when they are older]]
+ Make an informational page about Parental Alienation. Meant to be shared tactfully and compassionately with enablers of the alienator. Educate and inspire. 
+ I may not have been a parent to this young person. But I was a person who was active in their life. 
+ I lived with them. They knew me. They knew me as a safe person they could be themselves around. 
+ None of that changed within me, except for the circumstance. Unfortunate things happened and I became a homeless adult runaway. It was self-estrangement. I didn't want to be around them. Call it love from a distance or whatever. I lived my best life. I wasn't tied to anything and had nothing to lose. 
+ They are not bad or evil. They have good intentions. But they do extreme harm by means of a dysfunctional family dynamic.

All you need to do is tell her that I am not always fully there in the head, and that you should not take it personally when I ghost off into my own world. I've been in intentional recovery for years. I am always present in person as a care provider, but not always emotionally as a person. When I am here, please enjoy it and make good memories.

## Why I want nothing to do with my parents
This is really heavy and something I have done my best to bite my tongue on for a long time. I cut my mother off in 2017 and my father off in 2024 for very different and very similar reasons. Both of them have provided for my needs financially and otherwise growing up, and I am not separating myself from them for reasons of direct abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Put short, we don't have compatible realities, and their morals and values repulse me. They both live in very different delusional bubbles of the world based in racism on different types of brown people. I am not okay with the migrant detention and deportation of children, nor am I okay with the massacres and bombing of semitic children in the Levant and Middle East. I am a fluent Spanish speaker who considers themselves Sephardic Jewish and I have no loyalty to familial racism or war criminals. I am not okay with the generational curses that this results in, and have radically different notions of what human decency is. I don't want their money. Their beliefs, which in their mind are only targeted at people they deem as others, have profoundly harmed me and people I care about in my own life. I have gotten birth control surgery to prevent having offspring in part because I don't want to continue their bloodline. If I lived for myself, that would be one thing. But I live for others, and having them in my life presents a liability that I am not comfortable holding. I have tried everything in my power to peacefully coexist and hold
