2016
+ [[Woke up with freezing feet in the RV at Walmart|This is a journal entry I wrote back in December of 2016 when I was ridesharing south to North Carolina, and then Florida. I rode with a great man and his young son in their RV, and when we stopped at the Walmart in Johnson City, Tennessee to rest at night, we woke up to a 20 degree snowstorm that blocked us in for over a day. The fuse for the heater in the RV also broke, which meant we had to run the engine to stay warm.]]
