Shannons Ted talk

I was one of the first patrons at 12 Baskets Café. I had been recently homeless and on my own in that area in 2017 and had heard it was starting from Word of Mouth. While I am able to feed myself without the café, I am a regular patron who goes to eat and break bread with others. I wish I could say that I helped lay the bricks, that I washed dishes, served, or cleaned regularly. I don't. It's my designated useless space. 

I know many of the unhoused people in my community on a first name basis and have for years. I have associates and people I don't see eye to eye with. But as a whole, I feel so much safer in my community having those personal connections. I know that if I am the victim of a crime, that there are dozens more people who have my back and have constant eyes on everything happening around them. I know that if I have a little too much of something, such as shoes or catering event leftovers, I have people I can share that with. I have people that keep me grounded around accumulation and being content with the things I do have in this world. I also have a few older women who would beat the crap out of somebody for me if I ever needed it.
