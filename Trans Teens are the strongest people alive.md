I I can't imagine being a teenager today

I think it would be crushing I think I

would be deeply suicidal I have come

through a lot of that and I'm on the

other side of it I've been in my therapy

but if I didn't have a therapist I would

I would probably be very much on that

side of like I don't know if I can make

it in this world now I'm angry and like

I've been hardened by my experiences but

I also did not I grew up in a period of

time where people were mostly neutral

toward the idea of trans folks things

were starting to get a little bit better

with acceptance it's just it's a totally

different world now trans youth who are

out there surviving today are are truly

the strongest of us
