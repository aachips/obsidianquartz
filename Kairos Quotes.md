"We need not be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?"
- Ray Bradbury

"We are all just walking each other home"
- Ram Dass

"Language is a skin. I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire."
+ Roland Barthes

"Touching him was always so important to me. It was something I lived for. Little, nothing touches. My fingers against his shoulder. The outsides of our thighs touching as we squeezed together on the bus. I couldn't explain it, but I needed it. Sometimes I imagined stitching all of our little touches together. How many hundreds of thousands of fingers brushing against each other does it take to make love?"
+ Jonathan Safran Foer

"Withhold no good impulse- the more you give of yourself- in feelings, generosity, self expression, goodness, creativity, love, the more you will be given."
+ Deepak Chopra

"You must write every single day of your life.. You must lurk in libraries and climb the stacks like ladders to sniff books like perfumes and wear books like hats upon your crazy heads.. may you be in love every day for the next 20,000 days. And out of that love, remake a world."
+ Ray Bradbury

"When you meet anyone, remember it is a holy encounter. As you see him,  you will see yourself. As you treat him, you will treat yourself. As you think of him, you will think of yourself. Never forget this, for in him you will find yourself or lose yourself."

"Our lives are not as limited as we think they are; the world is a wonderfully weird place; consensual reality is significantly flawed; no institution can be trusted, but love does work, all things are possible, and we could all be happy and fulfilled if we only had the guts to be truly free and the wisdom to shrink our egos and quit taking ourselves so damn seriously."
+ Tom Robbins

"We are the bright new stars born of a screaming black hole, the nascent suns burst from the darkness, from the grasping void of space that folds and swallows--a darkness that would devour anyone not as strong as we. We are oddities, sideshows, talk show subjects. We capture everyone's imagination."
- Dave Eggers

"We are unraveling our navels so we may ingest the sun. We are not afraid of the darkness. We trust that the moon shall guide us. We are determining the future at this very moment. We know that the heart is the philosopher's stone. Our music is our alchemy."
- Saul Williams

"Every relationship you have ever formed is a closer look at yourself."
- Stephanie azaria

.. I am a combined effort of everyone I have ever known.

"What does patience feel like? It's a subtle unfolding with time as your ally. You feel relaxed and trust that it will all work out, even if in this very moment, there's no clear path to the end. It feels like the subtle uneasiness of allowing all you're uncomfortable with to be exactly as it is."
- Jackson Kiddard

"Would you like to save the world from the degradation and destruction it seems destined for? Then step away from shallow mass movements and quietly go to work on your own self-awareness. If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself. If you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, thene liminate all that is dark and negative in yourself. Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation."
- Lao





 “A Cherokee woman had more rights and power than European women. She decided whom she would marry, and the man built a house for her, which was considered her property, or else he came to her or her mother’s house to live. The house and children were hers. She and her brothers reared them. If she bore too many children, or if a child were deformed, she had the right to kill the unwanted infant. Should the father kill one, he would be guilty of murder. To obtain a divorce, she packed her husband’s clothes in a bag and set it outside her door. She was free to marry someone else, and so was he. Many divorces occurred, many remarriages. A system of serial monogamy developed, and adultery was common, even though frowned upon. The Cherokees, unlike most tribes, did not generally enforce laws against it.”

“In the short run […] the victims, themselves desperate and tainted with the culture that oppresses them, turn on other victims.”

“The cry of the poor is not always just, but if you don't listen to it, you will never know what justice is.”

“We live in a society absolutely dependent on science and technology and yet have cleverly arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. That's a clear prescription for disaster.” -Carl Sagan

“Is life worth living if you’re living in hell? When the mind is confined to a prison cell. And the lies they devise in a system that fell, I expect the system to fail.”
-Jedi Mind Tricks

“You’ve thrown the worst fear that could ever be hurled, the fear to bring children into this world.” –Bob Dylan


“Although children love to make a great commotion, they also long for quietness. As the decibels produced in billions of houses rise, everyone needs more silence. The hullabaloo of daily events is a constant challenge to an ear that listens: we miss the quietness of trees and of most living things. Yet allowing this quietness to reign in our lives today requires ingenuity. Silence unites all the faculties of the child. It embraces thinking, feeling, and willing; allows expectations to flourish; minds to open; stomachs to relax. Silence is the kindest, and most powerful starting point for stories. Creating silence is different from waiting for children to be quiet. It is an active, radiant power. In the atmosphere of silence our hearts center into gentle rhythms, our senses open, the very pores of our skin relax.”

Creating Silence – Passage in Storytelling with Children by Nancy Mellon

“Pipeline developers should be mindful that opposition groups are highly organized and have learned to utilize the regulatory process to maximize the review time required by the regulatory agency. Inattention to these groups and their issues can lead to slowdowns in project development and take a project to a point where it becomes unfeasible to implement.” --Rich Porter, director of Black & Veatch's Rates and Regulatory Advisory Services

Every gram of CO2 emitted by an automobile tail pipe lingers in the atmosphere for fifty years.

“Colonialism is not a machine capable of thinking, a body endowed with reason. It is naked violence.” -Frantz Fanon, Wretched of the Earth

“So delicately interwoven are the relationships, that when we disturb one thread of the community fabric, we alter it all. Perhaps almost imperceptibly, perhaps so drastically destruction follows.” - Rachel Carson

“When we organize with one another, when we get involved, when we stand up and speak out together. We create a power no government can suppress.” -Howard Zinn

“Extremists have shown what they fear most, a girl with a book” -Malala Yousafzai

“Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.” -HG Wells

“Why do we have to be a military superpower? Why can't we be a humanitarian superpower?”-Howard Zinn

“it was unlawful as well as unsafe to teach a slave to read.” -Frederick Douglas

“LSD wisely used by professionals, could reprogram enough nervous systems to accelerate consciousness and intelligence before we lay our planet waste.” -Timothy Leary

  

“I feel a desperation to make people see what they are doing to the environment. What a mess we are making of the world.” -Jane Goodall

  

“While our infrastructure was crumbling we built a new prison every 10 days from 1990 to 2005 to keep up with our mass of nonviolent offenders.” -Cory Brooker

  


“There is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy.”

“It is no longer enough, then, simply to state that we should be concerned for future generations. We need to see that what is at stake is our own dignity. Leaving an inhabitable planet to future generations is, first and foremost, up to us. The issue is one which dramatically affects us, for it has to do with the ultimate meaning of our earthly sojourn... “

“The Earth Charter asked us to leave behind a period of self-destruction and make a new start, but we have not as yet developed a universal awareness needed to achieve this. Here, I would echo that courageous challenge: 'As never before in history, common destiny beckons us to seek a new beginning... Let ours be a time remembered for the awakening of a new reverence for life, the firm resolve to achieve sustainability, the quickening of the struggle for justice and peace, and the joyful celebration of life.” -Pope Francis in Laudato Si

“Couldn't the increasing feeling of emptiness and worthlessness characteristic of depression be related to the society we live in? At a time when people lose themselves in consumption and mass entertainment to avoid thinking about their miserable life, their economic survival or the ongoing destruction of the planet? While the 'experts' paid by pharmacology corporations will invariably answer that depression is a brain disorder due to a 'chemical imbalance', the result of some faulty genes they have yet to identify, we cannot help to wonder how this could not be environmental considering there was no such thing as depression in Africa before colonization?” -Urgent message for those who have or are in danger of being labeled mentally ill.

  

“When whales were at their historical populations, before great numbers of them were killed. It seems they might have been responsible for removing tens of millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere, every single year. Whales change the climate. The return of the great whales if they are allowed to recover could be seen as a benign form of geo-engineering. It could undo some of the damage we have done both to the living systems of the sea, and to the atmosphere.”

  

“Boys and girls in America have such a sad time together; sophistication demands that they submit to sex immediately without proper preliminary talk. Not courting talk — real straight talk about souls, for life is holy and every moment is precious.” -Jack Kerouac-

On The Road

'What power means in the context of social change is of course the story of David and Goliath. When the Philistines sent their powerful warrior Goliath to go confront the Israelites, who are afraid. Until finally David, who is not a warrior, but a shepherd, went to King Saul and said 'let me go fight Goliath.' The king said 'you are not equipped, you've got to take my sword, my shield, my helmet.' They are so heavy he cannot move. He reflects for a second, 'Wait, I'm a shepherd, not a warrior.' he takes off all that armor, picks up a few stones, and goes to face Goliath. It's only when he discovers is own resources, not the ones of his opponent, as the foundation of his strategy, that things became to shift. And that's what creates those moments of opportunity for the Davids of this world.'

[Brandon Saul LaBonte](https://www.facebook.com/bplerrcockyshaman?fref=ufi) ‘Turn not your cheek away from people in scorn and pride, and walk not on earth haughtily; for God does not love anyone who acts proudly and boastfully. Be modest in your bearing and lower your voice; for the ugliest sound is the donkey’s braying.’

(Luqman 31: 18-19)

“It is the fate of great achievements, born from a way of life that sets truth before security, to be gobbled up by you and excreted in the form of shit. For centuries great, brave, lonely men have been telling you what to do. Time and again you have corrupted, diminished and demolished their teachings; time and again you have been captivated by their weakest points, taken not the great truth, but some trifling error as your guiding principle. This, little man, is what you have done with Christianity, with the doctrine of sovereign people, with socialism, with everything you touch. Why, you ask, do you do this? I don't believe you really want an answer. When you hear the truth you'll cry bloody murder, or commit it. … You had your choice between soaring to superhuman heights with Nietzsche and sinking into subhuman depths with Hitler. You shouted Heil! Heil! and chose the subhuman. You had the choice between Lenin's truly democratic constitution and Stalin's dictatorship. You chose Stalin's dictatorship. You had your choice between Freud's elucidation of the sexual core of your psychic disorders and his theory of cultural adaptation. You dropped the theory of sexuality and chose his theory of cultural adaptation, which left you hanging in mid-air. You had your choice between Jesus and his majestic simplicity and Paul with his celibacy for priests and lifelong compulsory marriage for yourself. You chose the celibacy and compulsory marriage and forgot the simplicity of Jesus' mother, who bore her child for love and love alone. You had your choice between Marx's insight into the productivity of your living labor power, which alone creates the value of commodities and the idea of the state. You forgot the living energy of your labor and chose the idea of the state. In the French Revolution, you had your choice between the cruel Robespierre and the great Danton. You chose cruelty and sent greatness and goodness to the guillotine. In Germany you had your choice between Goring and Himmler on the one hand and Liebknecht, Landau, and Muhsam on the other. You made Himmler your police chief and murdered your great friends. You had your choice between Julius Streicher and Walter Rathenau. You murdered Rathenau. You had your choice between Lodge and Wilson. You murdered Wilson. You had your choice between the cruel Inquisition and Galileo's truth. You tortured and humiliated the great Galileo, from whose inventions you are still benefiting, and now, in the twentieth century, you have brought the methods of the Inquisition to a new flowering. … Every one of your acts of smallness and meanness throws light on the boundless wretchedness of the human animal. 'Why so tragic?' you ask. 'Do you feel responsible for all evil?' With remarks like that you condemn yourself. If, little man among millions, you were to shoulder the barest fraction of your responsibility, the world would be a very different place. Your great friends wouldn't perish, struck down by your smallness.”

― Wilhelm Reich, Listen, Little Man!

"What They did not want you to ever find out is that your generation, the generation born between 1980-1995, actually outnumbers the Baby Boomers. They knew that if you ever turned your eye towards political reform, you could change the world.

They tried to keep you sated on vapid television shows and vapid music. They cut off your education and fed you brain candy. They took away your music and gave you Top Ten pop stations. They cut off your art and replaced it with endless reality shows for you to plug into, hoping you would sit quietly by as They ran the world. I think They thought you were too dumb to notice.

Indeed, I thought They had won.

But I watched you occupy the capital of Wisconsin. I see you today as you occupy Wall Street. And I see a spark, a glimmer of the glorious new age that is yours. A changing of the guard, a guard that has stood for entirely too long and needs your young legs to take his place.

I watch you turn away from what is easy and stand up for what is right. I see you understand we as a society are only as strong as our weakest link. I see you wise beyond your years. And I am proud. Give 'em hell, kids. You are beautiful." -Kate Danley

“Which is why it's not like the environmental problems we faced in the past. We can't solve it with a new law or a catalytic converter on our tailpipe. We need to upend the entire way we go about powering our lives, which is to say upend our economies and daily habits. And for American politicians, channeling American voters, that has always seemed far too much to contemplate. The definitive declaration came early on, from the first President Bush, as he prepared reluctantly to attend the huge 1992 environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro, when the worry about global warming was supposed to start yielding real results. Bush announced, “The American way of life is not up for negotiation.” – Bill McKibben. Changing the Climate ([http://prospect.org/article/changing-climate](http://prospect.org/article/changing-climate))

  

“I have observed that in the small town, the need to get along favors the passive aggressives, those for wohm honest differences and disagreements pose such a threat that they are so quickly submerged, left to fester in a complex web of resentments this is why, when the tempests erupt in the small-town teapot, they are so violently destructive. This is why, when the comfortable fiction that we’re all the same under the skin, is exposed as a lie, those who are genuinely different so often feel ostracized and eventually leave.” -Dakota: A Spiritual Geography. On conformity at the expense of community.

  

“When I speak of home, I mean not only the familial constellation from which I grew, but the entire Black community; the Black press, the Black church, Black academicians, the Black literati, and the Black left.” -Joseph Beam

  

“Life with dramatically lower energy consumption is inevitable, and that it's better to plan for it than to be taken by surprise. Our settlements and communities presently lack the resilience to enable them to weather the severe energy shocks that will accompany peak oil. That we have to act collectively, and we have to act now. That by unleashing the collective genius of those around us to creatively and proactively design our energy descent, we can build ways of living that are more connected, more enriching and that recognise the biological limits of our planet.”

Rob Hopkins; The four assumptions of the Transition Movement

  
  

Derek Jensen – published The Culture of Make Believe and Endgame

“Jensen's work is sometimes characterized as [anarcho-primitivist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism),[5][6] although he has categorically rejected that label, describing primitivist as a "racist way to describe indigenous peoples." He prefers to be called "[indigenist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenism)" or an "ally to the indigenous," because "indigenous peoples have had the only sustainable human social organizations, and... we need to recognize that we [colonizers] are all living on stolen land."[7]

Jensen sees [civilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization)[8] to be inherently unsustainable and based on [violence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence). He argues that the modern industrial economy is fundamentally at odds with healthy relationships, the [natural environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment), and [indigenous peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples). He concludes that the very pervasiveness of these behaviors indicates that they are diagnostic symptoms of the greater problem of civilization itself. Accordingly, he exhorts readers and audiences to help bring an end to [industrial civilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_civilization).

In A Language Older Than Words and also in an article entitled "Actions Speak Louder Than Words", Jensen states "Every morning when I awake I ask myself whether I should write or blow up a dam. I tell myself I should keep writing, though I'm not sure that's right".[9]

Jensen proposes that a different, harmonious way of life is possible, and that it can be seen in many societies including many [Native American](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas) or other indigenous cultures. He claims that "the fundamental difference between Western and indigenous ways of being is that even the most open-minded Westerners generally perceive listening to the natural world as a metaphor, as opposed to the way the world really is."[10] While indigenous peoples understand the world as consisting of other beings with whom we can enter into relationship, Westerners believe that the world consists of objects or resources to be exploited or used.”

“But the temperature target—pushed by wealthy nations in Europe and North America—would likely not be enough to save some low-lying small island states from annihilation. And in Africa, where drought linked to climate change was at that time menacing many lives in the eastern part of the continent, the target would translate into a full-scale [humanitarian disaster](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/06/19/what-climate-change-means-africa-asia-coastal-poor). Clearly the definition of “dangerous” climate change had more than a little to do with the wildly unequal ways in which human lives are counted.

But African delegates weren’t standing for it. When the text was leaked, the dull UN bureaucracy suddenly fell away and the sterile hallways of the conference centre came alive with shouts of, “We Will Not Die Quietly” and “2 Degrees is Suicide.” The paltry sums rich countries had pledged for climate financing were angrily dismissed as “not enough to buy us coffins.” Black lives matter, these delegates were saying—even if this corrupted forum was behaving as if that was far from the case.

The highly racialized discounting of certain lives does not just play out between countries but also, unfailingly, within them—perhaps most dramatically within the United States. I was reminded of this while reading about Akai Gurley, the unarmed 28-year-old black man who was “accidentally” shot and killed last month in the dark stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project. Like the dilapidated elevator, the lighting system in the building had been left unrepaired, despite complaints. And when that neglect of a public institution that disproportionately serves African-Americans intersected with armed fear of black men, the result was lethal.”[http://www.thenation.com/article/192801/what-does-blacklivesmatter-have-do-climate-change](http://www.thenation.com/article/192801/what-does-blacklivesmatter-have-do-climate-change)

  

“Arizona also had its own billboard bandits. In summer 1971, a group known as the Tucson Eco-Raiders began cutting down billboards, pouring lead onto the locks of developers' houses, pulling up survey stakes from housing developments, ripping electrical and plumbing fixtures out of sold houses, and sabotaging bulldozers. One member told a reporter that they bore “a grudge against developers who go in and flatten out everything.” In general, if we see a nice area of the desert being destroyed, we'll do something about it.” The group once left a pile of thousands of discarded cans and bottles at the doorstep of soft-drink bottler Kalil Company with a note reading, “A little non-returnable glass: Kalil makes it Tucson's problem. We make it Kalil's problem.---Eco-Raiders.” By 1973 the Eco-Raiders had torn down hundreds of billboards. Succumbing to pressure from developers, county officials allocated the resources necessary to catch the activists, who turned out to be five college-age boys “fed up with rampant development in Arizona.”

  “Oppose the destruction of our homeland. If resistance is not enough, subvert.” - Dave Foreman

“Anarchism is not a romantic fable, but the hardheaded realization, based on 5,000 years of experience, that we cannot entrust our management of our lives to kings, priests, politicians, generals, and county commissioners” – Edward Abbey

Monday Creek Watershed Restoration & Environmental Justice:

“While recognizing the impoverished characteristics of Appalachia, some might claim that residents are being targeted to absorb dangers and indirect costs of mining operations. Authors Newton and Lewish refer to this as ‘Job Blackmail.’ Residents of an underemployed and largely unemployed area are posed with the dilemma of either accepting much needed jobs at environmentally undesirable activity, or refusing questionable development in favor of environmental concerns. At the very least, there is certainly tension between the two.” 

“I am clearly not anti-environment, but I am very, very pro-job.” –Russell Tippett, Dean of Natural Resources & Ecological Sciences, Hocking College

It doesn’t surprise me that among the folks showing up at the 211 phone line that they are questioning the American Dream.. ‘You know it’s not part of the American Dream to call and ask for food help.’ ‘it’s not part of the American Dream to know I’m not going to be able to pay my rent.’ I think people still believe in the American Dream, and want the American Dream, I think there are more and more people being denied it by the growing income inequality. They are saying, ‘I work hard, I play by the rules, I see the corporate profits going through the roof, and I can’t get ahead.”

Chuck Sheketoff: Executive Director, Oregon Center for Public Policy

Quotes ripped from The Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resilience

By Rob Hopkins, Founder of the Transition Movement

“I grew up in England when the fossil fuel party was in full swing, in a culture ceaselessly trying to erase all traces of resilience and rubbishing the very idea at every opportunity, portraying country people as stupid, the traditional as ‘old-fashioned’ and growth and ‘progress’ as inevitable.” (13)

“Resilience: a culture based on its ability to function indefinitely and to live within its limits, and able to thrive for having done so.” (13)

“The very notion of economic globalization was only made possible by cheap liquid fossil fuels, and there is no adequate substitute for those on the scale that we use them. The move towards more localized energy efficient and productive living arrangements is not a choice; it is an inevitable direction for humanity.” (14)

“Our culture is underpinned by various stories, cultural myths that we all take for granted: that the future will be wealthier than the present, that economic growth can continue indefinitely, that we have become such an individualistic society that any common goals are unthinkable, that possessions can make you happy, and that economic globalization is an inevitable process to which we have all given our consent.” (14)

“The end of the Age of Cheap Oil is rapidly coming upon us, and life will radically change, whether we want it to or not.” (15)

“I am not afraid of a world with less consumerism, less ‘stuff’ and no economic growth. Indeed, I am far more frightened of the opposite: that the process which took fertilizer sacks to the most fertile fields I will probably ever stand it continues, reducing the ability of communities to support themselves beyond the brief, transitory historical interlude when industry was able to turn natural gas into a fertilizer and when the car was king.” (15)

“This book is underpinned by one simple premise: that the end of what we might call the Age of Cheap Oil (1859- present)is near at hand, and that for a society utterly dependent on it, this means enormous change; but that the future with less oil could be preferable to the present, if we plan sufficiently in advance with imagination and creativity.” (17)

“Without cheap oil, you wouldn’t be reading this book now. The centralized distribution of books would not have been feasible, and if you did have a copy, it would be one of only a very few books you had, and you would consider it a very precious possession indeed. I would not have been able to type it on my laptop, in a warm house, listening to CDs. When you really start thinking about it, it’s not just this book that would not be here. Most things around you rely on cheap oil for their manufacture and transportation. Your furniture, entertainment, recreation, food, household appliances, medicines, and cosmetics, are all dependent on this miraculous material. This is not a criticism, it's just how it is for us all, and has been for as long as most of us can remember. It is almost impossible to imagine anything else.” (18)

“The amount of energy needed to maintain the average US citizen is the equivalent of 50 people on bicycles pedaling furiously in our back gardens day and night.” Heinberg, R. (2003) The Party’s Over: oil, war, and the fate of industrial societies, Clairview Books P. 31.

“The key point here is that it is not the point when we use the last drop that matters. The moment that really matters is the peak, the moment when you realize that point onward there will always be less magic potion year-on-year, and that because of its increasing scarcity, it will become an increasingly expensive commodity.” (21)

“Chris Skrebowski, editor of Petroleum Review magazine, defines peak oil thus, “the point when that further expansion of oil production becomes impossible because new production flows are fully offset by production declines.” (21)

“We can also only add that denial in the face of potentially very threatening events is a powerful force in the human psyche.” (28)

“There is now no argument that the world is warming dangerously, possibly catastrophically, and there is an unprecedented scientific near-consensus that our oil-addicted lifestyles are to blame.” (33) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fourth Assessment Report, published in 2007, states that it has “very high confidence” (defined as being at least a 9 out of 10 chance of being correct) that “the global net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming.” IPCC Summary for Policymakers P.3

“As George Monbiot puts it, two degrees is “merely less dangerous than what lies beyond”, and indeed a recent paper by James Hansen et al. At NASA argues that even a 2C is too high given the rate of degeneration at the Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice sheets, and that 1.5-1.7C is more in line with adhering to the precautionary principle.” (33) Monbiot, G. (2006) Heat: how to stop the planet burning, Penguin. ----- Hansen, J, Sato, M, Kharecha, P, Russell, G, Lea, D. W. & Siddall, M. (2007) ‘Climate change and trace gases’, Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society A, Volume 365, number 1856, 15th July 2007. [www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/l3h462k7p4068780/fulltext.html](http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/l3h462k7p4068780/fulltext.html)

“If you think mitigated climate change is expensive, try unmitigated climate change.” –Dr. Richard Gammon, University of Washington, on the steps of the US Congress, June 28, 1999

“Climate Change says we should change, whereas peak oil says we will be forced to change. Both categorically state that fossil fuels have no role to play in our future, and the sooner we can stop using them the better.” (37)

“The recession caused by runaway oil prices will blow responses to climate change out of the water. Responding to climate change on an adequate scale requires a lot of money and an unprecedented degree of global cooperation. An economic recession – or worse, collapse – will make keeping the lights on our priority, and tackling climate change will slide rapidly down our list of priorities.” (39)

“One of the things peak oil does very effectively is put a mirror up to a community and ask: “What has happened to the ability of this community to provide for its basic needs?”” (39)

  

Ecopsychology Roszak Gomes & Cancer

“From a global vantage point [...] we live on a planet that is deteriorating ecologically and inhabited by people who are psychologically troubled.” [xiv]

  

“only succeed if it stabilizes population size, reestablishes a balance between people and nature”

Industrial revolution -> shift to fossil fuels….. ? -> shift away from them.

  

“Ecopsychology promises to make to environmental politics, is identification of irrational forces that tie people to their bad environmental habits.”

  

“It would be a grave error to say, as some evangelicals have told me, that it is fine to use nature destructively, because after all, God gave it to us. To squander a gift, to use it poorly, is to devalue the gift and insult the giver. If you give someone a present and he trashes it right in front of your face, you might feel insulted or disappointed; certainly you'll stop giving gifts to that person. I think that anyone who truly believes in God would not dare treat Creation that way but would instead make the most beautiful use possible of life.

  

“Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in, and I'll guarantee to take any one at random and train him or her to become any type of specialist I might select- doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and yes, even beggarman and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of their ancestors.” - John Watson, founder of Behaviorism

  

“In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed, they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy, and peace, and what did they produce? The cuckoo clock” -Orson Welles

  

“When I worked as a conservation lobbyist in D.C., I was told to put my heart in a safe deposit box and replace my brain with a pocket calculator. Be rational, not emotional, use facts and figures to quote economists and scientists. I would lose credibility I was told, if I let my emotions show. But damnit, I am an animal. A living being of flesh and blood, storm and fury.” Confessions of an Eco Warrior Dave Foreman

  

'But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.””Wherever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government.”

  

“The Indians, they had found, were too unruly to keep as a labor force, and remained an obstacle to expansion. Black slaves were easier to control, and their profitability for southern plantations was bringing in an enormous increase in the importation of slaves, who were becoming a majority in some colonies and constituted one-fifth of the entire colonial population. The blacks were not totally submissive, and as their numbers grew, the prospect of slave rebellion grew.” People's History Page 53 Howard Zinn

  

“ I once heard Martin Prechtel, speaking of his village in Guatemala, explain, “In my village, if you went to the medicine man with a sick child, you would never say, ‘I am healthy, but my child is sick.’ You would say, ‘My family is sick.’Or if it were a neighbor, you might say, “My village is sick,’” No doubt, in such a society, it would be equally inconceivable to say, “I am healthy, but the forest is sick/” To think anyone could be healthy when her family, her village, or indeed the land, the water, or the planet were not, would be as absurd as saying, “I’ve got a fatal liver disease, but that’s just my liver--I am healthy!” Just as my sense of self includes my liver, so theirs included their social and natural community.” P50 Sacred Economics

  

We missed our chance of an effortless transition in the 1960’s. “The longer the Age of Separation” persists, the more traumatic the transition will be, and the farther and more abrupt the drop to a sustainable baseline. Hasten the crash and mitigate its severity.” P 257 Sacred Economics

  

“There is a vast amount of important work to be done, work that is consistent with degrowth because it won’t necessarily produce salable product. There are forests to replant, sick people to care for, an entire planet to be healed. I think we are going to be very busy. We are going to work hard doing deeply meaningful things that no longer must fight upstream against the flow of money, the imperative of growth. “-P274

  

When did laziness be a crime punishable by poverty? “The laziness we view as human nature is a valid response to the kind of work our system engenders. If you find yourself being lazy, procrastinating, doing slipshod work, showing up late, not concentrating, and so on, perhaps the problem isn’t your character: Perhaps it is a soul’s rebellion against work that you don’t really want to do. It’s saying, ‘It is time to find your true work: that through which you can apply your gifts towards something meaningful.’ Ignore that message, and your unconscious will enforce it through depression, self-sabotage, illness, or accident, disabling you from living any more a life not aligned with your generosity.” Charles Eisenstein

  
  

“We've all been taught to consider these just women’s issues, even though they are issues concerning the majority of humanity. In reality these issues directly impact everything from environmental sustainability, and economic prosperity. At the Center for Partnership Studies we did a study called Women, Men, and the Global Quality of Life. We compared two bundles of statistical data from 89 nations. One bundle examined measures of general quality of life, from infant mortality, access to potable water, to disparity of wealth between those on top and bottom, environmental ratings, and so on. The other bundle consisted of measures of the status of women, what we found is that in significant respects, status of women is better predictor of general quality of life than GDP, which is what policy makers so heavily rely on.” -Riane Eisler [http://rianeeisler.com/](http://rianeeisler.com/)

Much of popular advocacy within mitigation and adaptation to climate collapse revolves around energy, as the centerpiece industrial sector of a large human struggle to move beyond industry. The energy sector contributes to the largest section of emissions directly, and even more than that indirectly. This is because our economy has foundations in petroleum based energies. I would argue that more importantly in solving the climate crisis we must direct our energy towards redefining labor. Our workforce represents the largest potential for harm or redirection towards good.

  

Yeah sure, climate change might definitely be happening, but why bother doing something about it? These things happen in nature. Dinosaurs have a rich history of oil spills and fracking.

If the aquifer which quenches the thirst of a region is contaminated with oil drilling poison, I'm definitely blaming sunspots.

“Arizona also had its own billboard bandits. In summer 1971, a group known as the Tucson Eco-Raiders began cutting down billboards, pouring lead onto the locks of developers' houses, pulling up survey stakes from housing developments, ripping electrical and plumbing fixtures out of sold houses, and sabotaging bulldozers. One member told a reporter that they bore “a grudge against developers who go in and flatten out everything.” In general, if we see a nice area of the desert being destroyed, we'll do something about it.” The group once left a pile of thousands of discarded cans and bottles at the doorstep of soft-drink bottler Kalil Company with a note reading, “A little non-returnable glass: Kalil makes it Tucson's problem. We make it Kalil's problem.---Eco-Raiders.” By 1973 the Eco-Raiders had torn down hundreds of billboards. Succumbing to pressure from developers, county officials allocated the resources necessary to catch the activists, who turned out to be five college-age boys “fed up with rampant development in Arizona.”

(Wikipedia: “The challenge today is how to develop a truly public ecology with new organizations, institutions, and ideas whose material articulation can balance the insights of scientific experts, the concerns of [private property](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property) holders, the worries about social inequity, and the need for ecological [sustainability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability) to support human and nonhuman life in the 21st century.” (Luke 2005)

“Public ecology is distinctive in that it explicitly and critically embraces its own normativity and uncertainty while striving to create a more democratic body of knowledge that will help us to understand the environment as a complex and dynamic biocultural system, one that can be interpreted from a variety of perspectives and points of view. Public ecology encourages citizens and all concerned stakeholders to participate with research scientists and professional policy-makers in the interdisciplinary, collaborative efforts necessary to resolve the uncertainty and conflict that surrounds contemporary environmental issues” (Robertson and Hull 2003)

“Public ecology is a more powerful [ecology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology). It is a body of environmental knowledge that seeks to bridge the gulf between science and policy. Public ecology not only exists at the interface of science and policy but functions as a joint product of these generally disparate realms. The language of public ecology facilitates the flow of ideas and information from one side to the other and back again.” (Robertson and Hull 2001)

“Language always comes with what is called "framing." Every word is defined relative to a conceptual framework. If you have something like "revolt," that implies a population that is being ruled unfairly, or assumes it is being ruled unfairly, and that they are throwing off their rulers, which would be considered a good thing. That's a frame.”

 “Cultural myths often stand in the way of human progress—in some cases producing devastating consequences. In fact, today millions of people around the world suffer the painful and often deadly effects of malaria because one person sounded a false alarm. That person is Rachel Carson, author of the 1962 best selling book Silent Spring. Many have praised Carson for raising concerns—some legitimate—about problems associated with the overuse of chemicals. Yet her extreme rhetoric generated a culture of fear, resulting in policies have deprived many people access to lifesaving chemicals. In particular, many nations curbed the use of the pesticide DDT for malaria control because Carson created unfounded fears about the chemical. As the world commemorates the 100th birthday (May 27, 2007) of the late Rachel Carson, it is time to acknowledge the unintended, adverse effects of Carson’s legacy and find ways to correct them.”

“But the temperature target—pushed by wealthy nations in Europe and North America—would likely not be enough to save some low-lying small island states from annihilation. And in Africa, where drought linked to climate change was at that time menacing many lives in the eastern part of the continent, the target would translate into a full-scale [humanitarian disaster](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/06/19/what-climate-change-means-africa-asia-coastal-poor). Clearly the definition of “dangerous” climate change had more than a little to do with the wildly unequal ways in which human lives are counted.

But African delegates weren’t standing for it. When the text was leaked, the dull UN bureaucracy suddenly fell away and the sterile hallways of the conference centre came alive with shouts of, “We Will Not Die Quietly” and “2 Degrees is Suicide.” The paltry sums rich countries had pledged for climate financing were angrily dismissed as “not enough to buy us coffins.” Black lives matter, these delegates were saying—even if this corrupted forum was behaving as if that was far from the case.

The highly racialized discounting of certain lives does not just play out between countries but also, unfailingly, within them—perhaps most dramatically within the United States. I was reminded of this while reading about Akai Gurley, the unarmed 28-year-old black man who was “accidentally” shot and killed last month in the dark stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project. Like the dilapidated elevator, the lighting system in the building had been left unrepaired, despite complaints. And when that neglect of a public institution that disproportionately serves African-Americans intersected with armed fear of black men, the result was lethal.”

Rachel Carson: “Nature as a household or home” resonated with women. Emphasized reproduction and children’s health, confirmed women’s right to work on public policy to threats to the home. She challenged man’s dominion and control over nature in her book The Silent Spring. She has been relentlessly attacked in her viewpoints. One excerpt from [www.rachelwaswrong.org](http://www.rachelwaswrong.org): 

Edward Bernays – Best propaganda artist

   [The] American business community was also very impressed with the propaganda effort. They had a problem at that time. The country was becoming formally more democratic. A lot more people were able to vote and that sort of thing. The country was becoming wealthier and more people could participate and a lot of new immigrants were coming in, and so on.   
     So what do you do? It's going to be harder to run things as a private club. Therefore, obviously, you have to control what people think. There had been public relation specialists but there was never a public relations industry. There was a guy hired to make Rockefeller's image look prettier and that sort of thing. But this huge public relations industry, which is a U.S. invention and a monstrous industry, came out of the first World War. The leading figures were people in the Creel Commission. In fact, the main one, Edward Bernays, comes right out of the Creel Commission. He has a book that came out right afterwards called Propaganda. The term "propaganda," incidentally, did not have negative connotations in those days. It was during the second World War that the term became taboo because it was connected with Germany, and all those bad things. But in this period, the term propaganda just meant information or something like that. So he wrote a book called Propaganda around 1925, and it starts off by saying he is applying the lessons of the first World War. The propaganda system of the first World War and this commission that he was part of showed, he says, it is possible to "regiment the public mind every bit as much as an army regiments their bodies." These new techniques of regimentation of minds, he said, had to be used by the intelligent minorities in order to make sure that the slobs stay on the right course. We can do it now because we have these new techniques.   
     This is the main manual of the public relations industry. Bernays is kind of the guru. He was an authentic Roosevelt/Kennedy liberal. He also engineered the public relations effort behind the U.S.-backed coup which overthrew the democratic government of Guatemala.   
     His major coup, the one that really propelled him into fame in the late 1920s, was getting women to smoke. Women didn't smoke in those days and he ran huge campaigns for Chesterfield. You know all the techniques—models and movie stars with cigarettes coming out of their mouths and that kind of thing. He got enormous praise for that. So he became a leading figure of the industry, and his book was the real manual.

This means when all car mileage in a given year is divided by the time spent supporting the car, the average car owner is traveling at an average speed of five miles per hour. To attain the speed of a bicycle, we are devastating our cities, air, lungs, and lives, while bringing on the threat of global warming.” (14)

“Peak Oil and Climate Change are a bigger threat together than either are alone. Our biggest hope is to similarly converge our understanding of them, and how to deal with the problems they present, Peak Oil and Climate Change must be fused as issues an approach is needed to deal with them as a package. If we are looking for answers, the env movement has pushed suitable ones for a long tie. Peak oil presents a tremendous chance to push these solutiosn ahead; failure to incorporate a full understanding of Peak Oil into the solutions argument for climate change would be an abject failure.” - James Howard Powerswitch.co.uk

“Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless – like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; you put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; you put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend” -Bruce Lee

“Framing the issues: UC Berkeley professor George Lakoff tells how conservatives use language to dominate politics”

“Language always comes with what is called "framing." Every word is defined relative to a conceptual framework. If you have something like "revolt," that implies a population that is being ruled unfairly, or assumes it is being ruled unfairly, and that they are throwing off their rulers, which would be considered a good thing. That's a frame.”

“The gift moves toward the empty place. As it turns in its ns toward him who
has been empty-handed the longest, and if someone appears elsewhere whose
need is greater it leaves its old channel and moves towards him. Our generosity
may leave us empty, but our emptiness then pulls gently at the whole until the
thing in motion returns to replenish us. Social nature abhors a vacuum.” –

Dilution is Solution to Pollution (1970’s) “When I worked at the US EPA in the 1970’s there was a sign on the wall of the adjacent office that said, “The Solution to Pollution is Dilution.”” Elizabeth Ward ([http://greenrisks.blogspot.com/2010/12/solution-to-pollution-is-dilution.html](http://greenrisks.blogspot.com/2010/12/solution-to-pollution-is-dilution.html))

“Many Christian fundamentalists feel that concern for the future of the planet is irrelevant, because it has no future. They believe we are living in the ‘end time,’ when the son of G-d will return, the righteous will enter heaven, and sinners condemned to hell fire. They may also believe, along with millions of other christian fundamentalists, that environmental destruction is not only to be disregarded, but actually welcomed - even hastened - as a sign of the coming apocalypse.” -Grist.org

“Every Arrebato rips you apart from your familiar home. Your relationship to the world is irrevocably changed. You’re aware of your vulnerabilities, wary of others, and no longer trust the universe. You are no longer who you used to be, abandoned by all that is familiar. You honor what has ended, say goodbye to the old way of being, and commit yourself to look for the ‘something new.’ It jerks you from the familiar and safe terrain and catapults you into Nepantla, split between before and after.”

“Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest

lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it

running.”

You must not wish for death. Death will come no matter, you must fight to live, as life is a miracle. –Unknown

The moral justification for intellectual property is, again, “If I am my own, and my labor power belongs to me, then what I make is mine.'” But even granting the premise that “I am my own,” the implicit assumption that artistic and intellectual creations arise ex nihilo from the mind of the creator, independent of cultural context, is absurd. Any intellectual creation (including this book) draws on bits and pieces of the sea of culture around us, and from the fund of images, melodies, and ideas that are deeply imprinted upon the human psyche, or perhaps, even innate to it. As Lewis Mumford puts it, “ A patent is a device that enables one man to claim special financial rewards for being the last link in the complicated social process that produced the invention.” The same is true of songs, stories, and all other cultural innovations. By making them private property, we are walling off something that is not ours. We are stealing from the cultural commons. And because, like lande, pieces of the cultural commons are themselves productive of continued wealth, this theft is an ongoing crime that contributes to the divide between the haves and the have-nots, the owners and the renters, the creditors and the debtors. “-Sacred Economics Page 71

  

“To introduce consumerism to a previously isolated culture it is first necessary to destroy its sense of identity. Here's how: Disrupt its networks of reciprocity by introducing consumer items from the outside. Erode its self-esteem with glamorous images of the West. Demean its mythologies through missionary work and scientific education. Dismantle its traditional ways of transmitting local knowledge by introducing schooling with outside curricula. Destroy its language by providing that schooling in English or another national or world language. Truncate its ties to the land by importing cheap food to make local agriculture uneconomic. Then you will have created a people hungry for the right sneaker.” - P 86 Sacred Economics from The Ascent of Humanity Charles Eisenstein

  

If we do not expand our moral imaginations, we will destroy ourselves, as thich nhat hanh said, we inter are, interconnection can be spiritual belief, but also a scientific fact, at its core interconnection is a survival strategy. “The unit of survival is the organism and its environment” Gregory Bateson next great rights battle fight to rescue air plants animals water energy and dirt. We have right to sustainable planet and future for our grandchildren, We are in a race between human consciousness and the physics and chemistry of the earth. In great hominid journey, no one knows what time it is, could be end, or beginning of next turning. We alive today share what MLK called the inescapable network of mutuality”” not without resources, have intelligence humor compassion family and friends and history of hominid ancestors. We can be restored, since beginning of time how many people have loved and cared for each other for us to be alive, how many fathers have hunted and fished fought off predators and planted grain so we could breath at this moment, how many mothers nursed baby and carried water so we could savor our small slice of time. We could never know significance of our individual actions but act every day as if our actions are significant. What is our alternative? “Even if I knew the Earth would fall to pieces, I would still plant a tree today.”

“It's a real challenge to figure out how do we communicate things that take years and years of technical understanding and compress it into seconds of speech.” - Edward Snowden

  

In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns. But we've discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning. We've learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose." Jimmy Carter -- A National Malaise. 1979.

“Climate disruption's assault on all we believed – endless progress, a stable future, our capacity to control the natural world with science and technology – will corrode the pillars that hold up the psyche of modern humanity. It will be physiologically destabilizing in a way exceeded in human history perhaps only by the shift to agriculture and the rise of industrial society. Already we find psychiatrists and psychologists issuing guidelines on how to respond to emotional and psychological distress associated with awareness of climate change, although the leading therapeutic recommendation to “be optimistic about the future” suggets that the mental health professionals have yet to grasp the seriousness of the threat posed by global warming. We can expect that, for a time, the loss of faith in the future and in our inability to control our lives will result in a proliferation of mental disturbance characterized by depression, withdrawal, and fearfulness.” -Clive Hamilton; Requiem for a Species

  

“It would be a mistake to think this culture clearcuts only forests. It clearcuts our psyche as well. It would be a mistake to think it dams only rivers. We ourselves are dammed (and damned) by it as well. It would be a mistake to think it creates dead zones only in the ocean. It creates dead zones in our hearts and minds. It would be a mistake to think it fragments only our habitat. We too are fragmented, split off, shredded, rent, torn.” -Derrick Jenson, Endgame

'A factory dumps pollution into the water or air because that's the ost efficient way to produce plastic or wood or pulp or steel. A TV station, magazine, or website dispenses sex and violence and 'pollutes' the cultural environment because that's the most efficient way to produce audiences. It pays to pollute. The psychic fallout is just the cost of doing business.'

“I see climate change as the ultimate espression of the violence of capitalism:

  

This economic model that fetishizes greed above all else is not just making lives miserable in the short term, it is on the road to making the planet uninhabitable in the medium term. And we know, scientifically, that if we continue with business as usual, that is the future we are heading towards> I think climate change is the strongest argument we've ever had against corporate capitalism, as well as the strongest argument we've ever had for the need for alternatives to it.” -Naomi Klein “Why Now? What's Next?” The Nation

The Ecology of Intimate Relationships:

 “While twenty-first-century mainstream Judeo-Christian doctrines concur in prescribing monogamy as the only appropriate form for marriage, this was not always the case. Insisting that everyone be monogamous is analogous to monocropping in agriculture where large corporate farms plant thousands of acres with just one crop, destroying the complex interrelated diversity of species that have coevolved ehealthy, sustainable ecosystems over many generations.” -Deborah Anapol

Monogamous marriage as the only appropriate form of love is like how corporate farms plant thousands of acres of one crop, destroying the complex interrelated diversity of species that have coevolved healthy, sustainable ecosystems over many generations.

  

“To observe without evaluating is the highest of human intelligence.” -Krishnamurti

  

“This is something a lot of people don't want to acknowledge—that our greatest differences, suffering, and pain are a form of fierce grace. They are potent and important components of our awakening, if we're ready for them. If we're ready to turn and face them, we can see and receive the gifts that they have to offer—even if the gifts sometimes feel like they are being forced upon us. Whether the circumstance is illness, the death of a loved one, divorce, addiction, problems at work-- it's important to face our life situations in order to see inherent gifts that are available. “ The end of your world – Life itself holds up a mirror for our awakening.

  
  

'The slightest improvement is of great value; There is tremendous value when you are able to deliberately cause even the slighest improvement in the way, you feel, for even in that small emotional improvement, you have regained a measure of control. You no longer feel powerless. And so, your trek back up the emotional scale is now not only possible, but it is relatively easy.''

  

“Satellite relationship means a close secondary relationship outside of that marriage which may or may not involve sexual intercourse, but which is valued for itself.. When two persons in a partnership learn to look upon each other as separate persons, with separate as well as mutual interests and needs, they are likely to discover that outside relationships are one of those needs.”

-Carl Rogers on modern marriage

"The crux of the problem is that the mainstream environmental movement has not sufficiently addressed the fact that social inequality and imbalances of social power are at the heart of environmental degradation, resource depletion, pollution and even overpopulation.

From 'The Socialist and the Suffragette,'

"A lifted world lifts women up," the Socialist explained. 

"You cannot lift the world at all.. While half of it is kept so small." the Suffragette maintained.

The world awoke, and tartly spoke;

"Your work is all the same, work together or work apart. Work, each of you, with all your heart - Just get into the game!"

-Charlotte Perkins Gilman

"Our democracy is but a name. We vote? What does that mean? It means that we choose between two bodies of real, though not avowed, autocrats. We choose between Tweedledee, and Tweedledum...

You ask for votes from women. What good can votes do when ten-elevenths of the land of Great Britain belongs to 200,000... and only one eleventh to the rest of the 40 million?? Have your men with their millions of votes freed themselves from this injustice?"

-Helen Keller 1911 to Suffragist in England

War is the Health of the State

--Notes from A Peoples' History of the United States

“Without dreams of hope and pride, a man will die. Though his flesh still moves, his heart sleeps in the grave. Without land, a man never dreams, cause he’s not free. All men need a place, to live with dignity. Take the crumbs from starving soldiers, they won’t die. Lord said not by bread, alone does man survive. Take the food from hungry children, they won’t cry. Food alone won’t ease, the hunger in their eyes. Every child belongs to mankinds’ family. Children are the fruit, of all humanity. Let them feel the love of all the human race. Touch them with the warmth, the strength of that embrace. Give me love, and understanding. I will thrive. As my children grow, my dreams come alive. Those who hear the cries of children, God will bless. I will always hear, the children of Sanchez.”
