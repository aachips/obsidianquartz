## July 2017 - What have I gotten myself into?

Three months after leaving my family, I've somehow found a partner with the same psychological makeup. Being myself around these kinds of people feels dangerous.

Food Issues: Being authentic extended to how I ate. Slurping soup would result in being told to "Eat like a human being," as if there's only one "correct" way, disregarding other cultures where it's normal. I was also policed on the amount of rice I ate. The constant "Don't tell me what to do in the kitchen" reflects a larger struggle for autonomy.

Pervasive Negativity: Life felt like a constant tragedy, with everything being terrible and the bleak assertion that we all die alone. This miserable whining, coupled with control issues, made me feel like a political prisoner.

Emotional Abuse: They hurt me, then denied it, masking their actions as love – classic gaslighting. Boundaries were nonexistent, leading to enmeshment. My feelings were irrelevant unless they served their needs. They seemed to seek out and create conflict. My mother would call her dog "retarded" because she couldn't call me that, a sentiment echoed by Amanda who used the word constantly. I was always told everything I did was wrong.

Triggered States: When overwhelmed, I need quiet. Any voice is like razors. Complete silence is necessary for me to focus. Internally, I'm experiencing overload and terror. I left my family because I genuinely feared for my safety, a fear amplified by past trauma. If I felt understood, my reactions would be considered normal. The lack of a safe home and the feeling of being endangered can lead to a breakdown. I don't need medication; I need understanding, shelter, and a safe space to cook. Tonight, I'm sleeping in my car. This isn't a plea for sympathy; I'm not a victim. I am who I am and don't need fixing or saving. I have no history of violence. I'm escaping a toxic relationship. I'm also anxious about encountering them in familiar places during this sweltering summer. The heat exacerbates my hypervigilance. I'm emotionally vulnerable and need to find refuge in shade and cooler temperatures.

Lack of Validation: I don’t feel heard, and my feelings don't seem valid. I feel strongly that the way you communicate is alienating, contributing to a lack of social support, intimate frustration, and the unresolved issue of your separation from your son. I want to connect with you, but I've learned to suppress my emotions due to the fear of being invalidated. My frustration is intense, sometimes manifesting in pulling my hair.

Current Situation and Fears: I'm currently living in my car, a better situation than Montgomery County. My energy is consumed by survival and trying to present my best self. I fear for my life and the lives of loved ones. These feel like years of constant danger, none of my own choosing. The climate is rapidly warming, and there's a rise in Nazi sentiment.

Premonitions and Safety: How do I protect myself from recurring premonitions of violent ambush? My 3:30 AM dream of evil spirits wasn't a friendly warning. On this cold, stormy night, I can feel the wind chill deeply. I want to finish my training and leave the area in January. Until then, I need to fully winterize and prepare myself.
