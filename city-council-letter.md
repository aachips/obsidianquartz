# Dear City Council,

I was homeless / without housing for several years between 2015 and 2019. Now I am a productive worker and thriving member of society. Here is part of my story, and policy recommendations backed by case study sources. All of these policy recommendations are cheaper in the long-run than the current situation, and much more humane.

My background is that I am an adult on the spectrum who had a severe and undiagnosed allergy to dust mites for years that made it very difficult to live in many rental units. I did not know what my allergy was for many years, and without great answers from doctors, I thought I had a terminal disease. Finding affordable, and accessible housing in 2019 was a nightmare, and the problem has only gotten worse. I don’t have the energy each day to submit a dozen applications. I would have never gotten back into housing without affordable options. 

When I was without housing I had my car, which I could sleep in comfortably. I had to do this in stealth and be hyper aware of my surroundings constantly both because of crime, and because of the police. It was often very difficult to find safe places to park, and without access to safe public bathrooms around the clock, I’d have to keep a medical toilet in my vehicle to prevent being a greater public health risk to others. Every day I would participate in free meal programs around the city, finding opportunities to volunteer and break bread with others who are dealing with a housing crisis. I met many people. Some very desperate for the very basic dignity and meeting of needs many of us take for granted. 

Here are three real case studies which examined both the cost of homelessness, and the cost of ending homelessness by providing everybody in need with housing and their most basic needs:

### The 100,000 Homes Campaign (US)

The 100,000 Homes Campaign was a nationwide effort in the United States aimed at housing 100,000 of the country's most vulnerable homeless individuals between 2010 and 2014. The campaign used a "Housing First" approach, which prioritizes permanent housing and supportive services for people experiencing chronic homelessness.

The results of the campaign showed that providing housing and support services to homeless individuals was significantly less expensive than allowing them to remain homeless. For example, in the city of Phoenix, Arizona, the cost of providing housing and services to a chronically homeless person was estimated at $14,961 per year. In comparison, the annual cost of emergency services (including hospitalizations, jail stays, and emergency shelter) for a chronically homeless person was estimated at $40,500. By providing housing and support services to 1,000 chronically homeless individuals in Phoenix, the city saved an estimated $20 million over the course of two years.

### The At Home/Chez Soi Project (Canada)

The At Home/Chez Soi Project was a large-scale research initiative in Canada that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a Housing First approach in ending homelessness. The project provided housing and support services to 2,1 homeless individuals in five Canadian cities between 2008 and 2013.

The results of the project showed that providing housing and support services to homeless individuals was significantly less expensive than allowing them to remain homeless. For example, in the city of Montréal, the average annual cost of providing housing and support services to a homeless individual was estimated at $27. In contrast, the average annual cost of emergency services for a homeless individual was estimated at $8,28. By providing housing and support services to homeless individuals, the At Home/Chez Soi Project saved an estimated $1 million in emergency service costs over the course of the project.

### The Housing First Project (United Kingdom)

The Housing First Project was a research initiative in the United Kingdom that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a Housing First approach in ending homelessness. The project provided housing and support services to 40 homeless individuals in 11 cities across the UK between 2009 and 2013.

The results of the project showed that providing housing and support services to homeless individuals was significantly less expensive than allowing them to remain homeless. For example, in the city of Manchester, the average annual cost of providing housing and support services to a homeless individual was estimated at £1,23. In contrast, the average annual cost of emergency services for a homeless individual was estimated at £23. By providing housing and support services to homeless individuals, the Housing First Project saved an estimated £1 million in emergency service costs over the course of the project.

These case studies demonstrate that providing housing and support services to homeless individuals is not only the morally right thing to do, but it is also significantly less expensive than allowing them to remain homeless. By investing in housing and support services for homeless individuals, communities can save millions of dollars in emergency service costs, while also improving the lives and well-being of some of the most vulnerable members of society.

### Policy Recommendations

- Housing First: Prioritize providing permanent, affordable housing without preconditions like sobriety or employment. This approach has been proven effective in reducing chronic homelessness and associated costs.
- Increased Funding for Affordable Housing: Invest in the construction and maintenance of affordable housing units, including supportive housing options with integrated services.
- Rental Assistance Programs: Expand rental assistance programs to prevent individuals and families from becoming homeless in the first place.
- Public Bathroom Access: Install and maintain clean, safe, and accessible public restrooms throughout the city. This is crucial for public health and the dignity of all residents, including those experiencing homelessness.
- Alternative Crisis Response Teams: Develop and fund trained crisis response teams consisting of mental health professionals, social workers, and other specialists to respond to non-violent situations involving individuals experiencing homelessness or mental health crises. This can reduce reliance on police intervention and connect individuals with appropriate services.
- Decriminalization of Homelessness: Repeal or amend laws that criminalize activities associated with homelessness, such as sleeping in public or panhandling. Instead, focus on providing resources and support.
- Collaboration and Coordination: Foster collaboration between government agencies, non-profit organizations, and community groups to create a coordinated system of care for individuals experiencing homelessness.
- Data Collection and Evaluation: Implement a robust system for collecting and analyzing data on homelessness to track progress, identify gaps in services, and inform future policy decisions.
