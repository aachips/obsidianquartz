The Paradox of Our Age

We have bigger houses,
and smaller families;
More convenience,
but less time;

we have more degrees, but less sense,
more knowledge, but less judgment;
more experts, but more problems;
more medicine, but less health;

We have been all the way to the moon and back,
but have trouble crossing the road to meet the new neighbor.

We built more computers to hold more information to produce more copies than ever,
but less communication.

We have become long on quantity, but short on quality,
These are times of fast foods,
and slow digestion;

Tall man, and short character
Steep profits, and shallow relationships,

It is time where there is much in the window,
and nothing in the room.

-HH Dalai Lama
