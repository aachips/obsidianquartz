Something about me is that I was homeless for part of my life. This looked different each year that it occurred. 

When many people think about homelessness, they have a single concept of what it looks like. Maybe someone sleeping on the sidewalk begging for change.

Homelessness can look a lot of ways. There are homeless people who stay with friends or family on couches and guest rooms but do not have a permanent address. There are homeless people who live in vehicles. There are homeless people who live in the woods in tents. There are homeless people who work full time jobs and exist that way in stealth. There are homeless people who stay in shelters, and those who cannot because of various safety concerns.

According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, homelessness can present itself in various forms, such as living on the streets, in shelters, in vehicles, or in other temporary locations. A study by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found that there were over 567,000 people experiencing homelessness in the United States on a single night in January 2019, with 37% staying in unsheltered locations (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2021)

In 2014 I was with a group that walked across America. Different story for a different day. 
In 2015 and 2016 I lived in my hometown half of the time in my car rotating between different friends and family who would let me come inside and use indoor plumbing, refrigeration, and wifi. The other half of the time I was hitchhiking, greyhounding, and couchsurfing in various places around the country to attend environmental conferences and demonstrations. I'd always come back to my hometown because I liked being in my Niece's life and being a positive presence and support person.
In early 2017, it became dangerous to stay in my hometown living in my car. I had a falling out with my mother and she threatened to have the police do a wellness check on me. This is very dangerous when you live out of your car. I also was staying with a close friend of mine who was regularly targeted by the local police for having filed complaints against some of the members. The wellness check threat may have been racially charged. There are many adults with developmental disabilities who are killed during wellness checks by the police. There were other things going on at that time in America, too. I was scared and acted to leave the state with a car full of my belongings and moved hundreds of miles away to be homeless in a new state.

I will be sharing more stories from these chapters of my life in other videos. I will also take video topic requests in the comments.
