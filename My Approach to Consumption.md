## My Approach to Consumption

April Chips Early

When asked about upcoming purchases, I struggle to answer—not because I can't afford things, but because buying isn't central to my lifestyle. Living below the poverty line for most of my adult life has shaped a deliberately minimal approach to consumption.

## How I Meet Basic Needs Without Traditional Spending

### Food

- I cook most meals as a professional home cook
- I participate in free community meal programs
- My apple chip business uses surplus fruit that would otherwise go to waste
- In earlier years, I rescued discarded food through dumpster diving
- Now I work with nonprofits to legitimately redirect food waste

### Transportation

- I drive less than 10,000 miles yearly in a low-maintenance vehicle
- Regular maintenance happens at a trusted local shop that doesn't invent problems
- I focus on necessary repairs only—oil changes, occasional tire replacements, brake pads

### Household & Personal Items

- I help people clear out homes and storage units when they leave town
- In exchange, I redistribute their unwanted belongings
- Last month, this yielded clothes, books, art supplies, and even a PlayStation 3
- Most items I receive are given away to others in need

### Financial Approach

- I maintain zero debt
- My part-time job covers basic monthly expenses
- My small business fills occasional financial gaps
- I practice extreme intentionality with spending

### Leisure & Self-Care

- Annual camping trip replaces expensive vacations
- I haven't flown or stayed in hotels in years
- I manage health through nutrition, rest, and preventive practices
- I've adapted to minimal healthcare access despite having pre-existing conditions

## My Essential Purchases

Despite my minimal consumption habits, two unavoidable expenses remain central to my life:

1. **Housing**: Monthly rent ensures I have safe, stable shelter
2. **Transportation**: Occasional gas fill-ups keep my car running for essential travel

## The Bigger Picture

This lifestyle isn't about deprivation—it's about intention. By stepping outside consumer culture, I've found greater freedom and resilience. My approach might seem extreme to some, but it offers a perspective on what's truly necessary versus what's merely expected in our consumption-driven society.
