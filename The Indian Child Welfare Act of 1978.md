"ICWA's purpose is to preserve and promote children's connection to their families and tribes. ICWA intervenes to prevent inappropriate child removals and placements. ICWA compliance requires judges to identify any Indian child in the system and then follow ICWA's mandates"

ICWA is a federal act of legislation that was passed to remediate the damages caused from generations of Native children being taken away from tribes in an ill attempt of rescue. The rubrics used today to assess for child abuse and neglect are culturally biased towards whiteness in America, and very often Native Americans are disproportionately targeted by child welfare agencies. ICWA is more than a law, it represents a legitimization of Native American familial structures in custody determinations. It is a different paradigm on child custody. Even in 2022, many Judges are not informed about ICWA because they falsely believe they do not have Native American children in their jurisdiction due to false beliefs about Native erasure and those cultures being a relic of the past.

In Native families, a child's support network is extended with cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, all of whom are involved and fill parental roles in the child's life. Removing a child from that family structure is tantamount to abuse. Often the dominant cultures paradigm of custody is adversarial, where one parent fights the other parent. In a Native American family structure, all members of that childâ€™s life would come together for a meeting and find solutions when problems come up. This is not just with Native Americans, but many types of family systems based on tribalism.

As of this November of 2022, a case is being heard by the Supreme Court challenging to remove protections of the Indian Child Welfare Act. This is a pressing issue and threat to protections for Native American tribes retaining rights to their culture and their children (AP News, 2022.)

The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), enacted in 1978, is a crucial federal law aimed at safeguarding the connection between Native American children, their families, and their tribes. Recognizing the historical injustices of forced removal and assimilation practices, ICWA seeks to prevent unwarranted removal of Native children from their cultural heritage and ensure appropriate placements when removal is necessary. Compliance with ICWA mandates that judges identify any Indian child within the child welfare system and adhere to the Act's specific provisions.

### Historical Context: Addressing Colonial Violence and Boarding Schools

ICWA was a direct response to generations of Native American children being separated from their families and tribes, often under the guise of rescue. This practice was rooted in culturally biased child welfare standards that disproportionately targeted Native families. During the mid-1800s to the late 1900s, the U.S. government's reservation system led to tribal dependence, which was exploited to coerce the surrender of Native children to Catholic-run boarding schools. The assimilationist motto of these schools, "Kill the Indian, Save the Man," involved the suppression of Native languages and cultures through harsh punishments. Tragically, a devastating number of children perished in these institutions due to disease, abuse, neglect, and despair. Even in the 1970s, statistics revealed that one in four Native children lived away from their families in various settings, including adoption, foster care, institutions, and boarding schools.

### ICWA as a Paradigm Shift in Child Custody

ICWA represents a fundamental shift in how child custody is determined for Native American families. It acknowledges and legitimizes the extended family structures prevalent in Native cultures, where cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents play significant parental roles in a child's life. Removing a child from this supportive network is considered deeply detrimental. In contrast to the often adversarial nature of child custody proceedings in dominant culture, Native American family systems often prioritize collective problem-solving through family and community meetings. This more holistic approach, based on tribal values, offers valuable lessons for the broader child welfare system.

### The Importance and Misunderstanding of ICWA

Despite its significance in protecting Native American tribal cultures, ICWA remains one of the most misunderstood and inconsistently enforced federal laws. A persistent misconception among some judges is that ICWA does not apply in their jurisdiction due to inaccurate beliefs about Native American erasure. However, as emphasized by judges across the country, Native American children to whom ICWA applies exist in every jurisdiction.

### What ICWA Accomplishes

ICWA establishes vital safeguards to keep Native children connected to their culture. It recognizes the unique needs and strengths of Native families and prioritizes placement with extended family members, tribal members, or other Native American families when removal from the immediate family is necessary. The Act stands against the forced assimilation and cultural destruction historically inflicted upon Native communities. The principles underlying ICWA align with international declarations on the rights of Indigenous peoples, which affirm the right to live in freedom, peace, and security as distinct peoples and to not be subjected to forced removal of children or cultural destruction.

### Judicial Perspectives on ICWA

Honorable Louis Trosch, Jr., and Honorable Karen Adam, both judges with extensive experience applying ICWA, underscore its importance in allowing them to act in the best interests of Native American children and families. They stress the crucial need for all judges to understand and diligently implement ICWA.

### Understanding the Cultural Context for Child Welfare

Knowledge of religious and spiritual beliefs is paramount when working with clients from diverse backgrounds. In the context of Native American families, understanding tribal customs, extended family roles, and community-based support systems is essential for culturally competent child welfare practices. ICWA itself reflects the cultural values and approaches to family support within Native communities.

### Resources for Further Understanding

Resources such as the Native American Rights Fund's educational video provide valuable insights into ICWA and its implementation. Understanding the historical context and the intent behind ICWA is crucial for its effective application and for ensuring the well-being of Native American children and the preservation of their tribal heritage.
