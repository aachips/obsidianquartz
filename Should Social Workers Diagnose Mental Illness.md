Manual warnings stem from tragic past errors, leading to safety protocols across disciplines, including social sciences with their ethics codes. Psychology's harmful historical studies spurred moral interventions like those involving electroshock therapy on children and LGBTQ+ individuals, highlighting the principle of learning from past mistakes. Social work, focused on addressing poverty, evolved from initiatives like the Children’s Aid Society and the Catholic Worker Movement. The NASW Ethics Code, established in 1960, aims to prevent repeated harm, reinforcing the idea that we improve with knowledge. The central question is whether it's ethical for social workers to diagnose mental health issues. This author argues it is deeply unethical, proposing an alternative and drawing parallels with problematic practices in medicine and psychiatry, citing instances of harm caused by such diagnoses. The core belief is that social workers should aid those structurally harmed, and diagnosing mental illness perpetuates stigma and harm, contradicting social work principles. Psychiatrists undergo extensive medical training that LCSWs lack, and mental illnesses are medical conditions. Therefore, mental health diagnoses by LCSWs should be reviewed by psychiatrists. It is better to document behaviors objectively rather than offering evaluations, which should be performed by independent medical specialists.

Making an evaluation on an official report over a home visit, custody evaluation, witness testimony, is often a weapon to discredit and destroy someone’s autonomy, take away their rights as people. Social Work originated as a field to uplift people, and combat structural poverty. Having the authority to do incomplete, botched, and incompetent medical diagnoses, is more dangerous than a law enforcement with domestic violence charges handling firearms.**Manual warnings often originate from tragic real-world experiences, highlighting the importance of safety protocols across all social sciences, including psychology and social work. The development of ethical codes in these fields stems from past harmful practices, such as electroshock therapy on children, belittling orphans, and harmful attempts to alter sexual orientation or gender identity. The principle "when we know better, we do better" underscores the necessity of learning from these errors.

While helping others is age-old, formal Social Work emerged to address poverty, a complex issue with debated origins. Key milestones in the evolution of Social Work include the establishment of organizations like the Condition of the Poor and Children’s Aid Society, the Freedmen’s Bureau, the Neighborhood Guild, and the Catholic Worker Movement. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) first established its Code of Ethics in 1960, a living document intended to prevent the repetition of past harms.

The central argument presented is that it is unethical for social workers to diagnose mental health issues, a practice that has become common but is viewed as inappropriate. The alternative involves focusing on a social worker's core purpose: assisting individuals structurally harmed by society. Engaging in diagnosis risks perpetuating stigma and undermining the fundamental principles of Social Work.
  
Drawing parallels with Medical Science and Psychiatry, the text emphasizes the medical nature of mental illness, noting that psychiatrists undergo extensive medical training that Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSWs) do not. Instead of diagnosing, social workers should document specific behaviors and actions, leaving medical evaluations to qualified medical specialists. Instances of harm caused by social workers performing mental health diagnoses further support this stance.

The power to diagnose can be misused, serving as a tool to strip individuals of their autonomy and rights, contradicting Social Work’s foundational aim of uplifting people and combating poverty. Allowing professionals without medical training to make mental health diagnoses is deemed a dangerous practice with potentially severe consequences. The ability to diagnose, while seemingly empowering, can be detrimental and should be reserved for those with appropriate medical expertise.
